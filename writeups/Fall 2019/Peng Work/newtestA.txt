With successive editionsover the past 60 years, it has become a standard reference for clinical practice in the mentalhealth field. Since a complete description of the underlying pathological processes is notpossible for most mental disorders, it is important to emphasize that the current diagnos-tic criteria are the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed andcan be recognized by trained clinicians. DSM is intended to serve as a practical, functional,and flexible guide for organizing information that can aid in the accurate diagnosis andtreatment of mental disorders. It is a tool for clinicians, an essential educational resourcefor students and practitioners, and a reference for researchers in the field.Although this edition of DSM was designed first and foremost to be a useful guide toclinical practice, as an official nomenclature it must be applicable in a wide diversity ofcontexts. DSM has been used by clinicians and researchers from different orientations (bi-ological, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, family/systems), all ofwhom strive for a common language to communicate the essential characteristics of men-tal disorders presented by their patients. The information is of value to all professionalsassociated w ith var ious aspects of menta l health care , including psych iatrists , otherphysicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, forensic and legal special-ists, occupational and rehabilitation therapists, and other health professionals. The criteriaare concise and explicit and intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom pre-sentations in a variety of clinical settings—inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consul-tation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care—as well in general communityepidemiological studies of mental disorders. DSM-5 is also a tool for collecting and com-municating accurate public health statistics on mental disorder morbidity and mortalityrates. Finally, the criteria and corresponding text serve as a textbook for students early intheir profession who need a structured way to understand and diagnose mental disordersas well as for seasoned professionals encountering rare disorders for the first time. Fortu-nately, all of these uses are mutually compatible.These diverse needs and interests were taken into consideration in planning DSM-5.The classification of disorders is harmonized with the World Health Organization’s Inter-national Classification of Diseases (ICD), the official coding system used in the United States,so that the DSM criteria define disorders identified by ICD diagnostic names and codenumbers. In DSM-5, both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes (the latter scheduled for adop-tion in October 2014) are attached to the relevant disorders in the classification.Although DSM-5 remains a categorical classification of separate disorders, we recog-nize that mental disorders do not always fit completely within the boundaries of a singledisorder. Some symptom domains, such as depression and anxiety, involve multiple di-agnostic categories and may reflect common underlying vulnerabilities for a larger groupof disorders. In recognition of this reality, the disorders included in DSM-5 were reorderedinto a revised organizational structure meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives. Thisnew structure corresponds with the organizational arrangement of disorders planned forICD-11 scheduled for release in 2015. Other enhancements have been introduced to pro-mote ease of use across all settings:xlixliiPreface• Representation of developmental issues related to diagnosis. The change in chapterorganization better reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders more frequently diag-nosed in childhood (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the man-ual and disorders more applicable to older adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive disorders)at the end of the manual. Also, within the text, subheadings on development and courseprovide descriptions of how disorder presentations may change across the lifespan.Age-related factors specific to diagnosis (e.g., symptom presentation and prevalencedifferences in certain age groups) are also included in the text. For added emphasis,these age-related factors have been added to the criteria themselves where applicable(e.g., in the criteria sets for insomnia disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, spe-cific criteria describe how symptoms might be expressed in children). Likewise, genderand cultural issues have been integrated into the disorders where applicable.• Integration of scientific findings from the latest research in genetics and neuroimag-ing. The revised chapter structure was informed by recent research in neuroscience andby emerging genetic linkages between diagnostic groups. Genetic and physiologicalrisk factors, prognostic indicators, and some putative diagnostic markers are high-lighted in the text. This new structure should improve clinicians’ ability to identify di-agnoses in a disorder spectrum based on common neurocircuitry, genetic vulnerability,and environmental exposures. 
• Consolidation of autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmen-tal disorder into autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms of these disorders represent asingle continuum of mild to severe impairments in the two domains of social commu-nication and restrictive repetitive behaviors/interests rather than being distinct disor-ders. This change is designed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria forthe diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and to identify more focused treatment tar-gets for the specific impairments identified.• Streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders. Bipolar and depres-sive disorders are the most commonly diagnosed conditions in psychiatry. It was there-fore important to streamline the presentation of these disorders to enhance both clinicaland educational use. Rather than separating the definition of manic, hypomanic, andmajor depressive episodes from the definition of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder,and major depressive disorder as in the previous edition, we included all of the com-ponent criteria within the respective criteria for each disorder. This approach will facil-itate bedside diagnosis and treatment of these important disorders . Likewise , theexplanatory notes for differentiating bereavement and major depressive disorders willprovide far greater clinical guidance than was previously provided in the simple be-reavement exclusion criterion. The new specifiers of anxious distress and mixed fea-tures are now fully described in the narrative on specifier variations that accompaniesthe criteria for these disorders.• Restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity. The categoriesof substance abuse and substance dependence have been eliminated and replaced withan overarching new category of substance use disorders—with the specific substanceused defining the specific disorders. “Dependence” has been easily confused with theterm “addiction” when, in fact, the tolerance and withdrawal that previously defineddependence are actually very normal responses to prescribed medications that affectthe central nervous system and do not necessarily indicate the presence of an addiction.By revising and clarifying these criteria in DSM-5, we hope to alleviate some of thewidespread misunderstanding about these issues.• Enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders. Given the explo-sion in neuroscience, neuropsychology, and brain imaging over the past 20 years, it wascritical to convey the current state-of-the-art in the diagnosis of specific types of disor-ders that were previously referred to as the “dementias” or organic brain diseases. Bi-ological markers identified by imaging for vascular and traumatic brain disorders andPrefacexliiispecific molecular genetic findings for rare variants of Alzheimer’s disease and Hun-tington’s disease have greatly advanced clinical diagnoses, and these disorders andothers have now been separated into specific subtypes. 
• Transition in conceptualizing personality disorders. Although the benefits of a moredimensional approach to personality disorders have been identified in previous edi-tions, the transition from a categorical diagnostic system of individual disorders to onebased on the relative distribution of personality traits has not been widely accepted. InDSM-5, the categorical personality disorders are virtually unchanged from the previousedition. However, an alternative “hybrid” model has been proposed in Section III toguide future research that separates interpersonal functioning assessments and the ex-pression of pathological personality traits for six specific disorders. A more dimensionalprofile of personality trait expression is also proposed for a trait-specified approach. 
• Section III: new disorders and features. A new section (Section III) has been added tohighlight disorders that require further study but are not sufficiently well established tobe a part of the official classification of mental disorders for routine clinical use. Dimen-sional measures of symptom severity in 13 symptom domains have also been incorpo-rated to allow for the measurement of symptom levels of varying severity across alldiagnostic groups. Likewise, the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), astandard method for assessing global disability levels for mental disorders that is basedon the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and is ap-plicable in all of medicine, has been provided to replace the more limited Global As-sessment of Functioning scale. It is our hope that as these measures are implementedover time, they will provide greater accuracy and flexibility in the clinical description ofindividual symptomatic presentations and associated disability during diagnostic as-sessments.• Online enhancements.

This section is a basic orientation to the purpose, structure, content, anduse of DSM-5. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive account of the evo-lution of DSM-5, but rather to give readers a succinct overview of its key ele-ments. The introductory section describes the public, professional, and expertreview process that was used to extensively evaluate the diagnostic criteriapresented in Section II. A summary of the DSM-5 structure, harmonization withICD-11, and the transition to a non-axial system with a new approach to as-sessing disability is also presented. “Use of the Manual” includes “Definition ofa Mental Disorder,” forensic considerations, and a brief overview of the diag-nostic process and use of coding and recording procedures.This page intentionally left blank 
IntroductionThe creation of the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5) was a massive undertaking that involved hundreds of people working toward acommon goal over a 12-year process. Much thought and deliberation were involved inevaluating the diagnostic criteria, considering the organization of every aspect of the man-ual, and creating new features believed to be most useful to clinicians. All of these effortswere directed toward the goal of enhancing the clinical usefulness of DSM-5 as a guide inthe diagnosis of mental disorders.Reliable diagnoses are essential for guiding treatment recommendations, identifyingprevalence rates for mental health service planning, identifying patient groups for clinicaland basic research, and documenting important public health information such as mor-bidity and mortality rates. As the understanding of mental disorders and their treatmentshas evolved, medical, scientific, and clinical professionals have focused on the character-istics of specific disorders and their implications for treatment and research. 
While DSM has been the cornerstone of substantial progress in reliability, it has been wellrecognized by both the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the broad scientific com-munity working on mental disorders that past science was not mature enough to yield fullyvalidated diagnoses—that is, to provide consistent, strong, and objective scientific validatorsof individual DSM disorders. The science of mental disorders continues to evolve. However,the last two decades since DSM-IV was released have seen real and durable progress in suchareas as cognitive neuroscience, brain imaging, epidemiology, and genetics. The DSM-5 TaskForce overseeing the new edition recognized that research advances will require careful, iter-ative changes if DSM is to maintain its place as the touchstone classification of mental disor-ders. Finding the right balance is critical. Speculative results do not belong in an officialnosology, but at the same time, DSM must evolve in the context of other clinical research ini-tiatives in the field. One important aspect of this transition derives from the broad recognitionthat a too-rigid categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientificobservations. The results of numerous studies of comorbidity and disease transmission in fam-ilies, including twin studies and molecular genetic studies, make strong arguments for whatmany astute clinicians have long observed: the boundaries between many disorder “catego-ries” are more fluid over the life course than DSM-IV recognized, and many symptoms as-signed to a single disorder may occur, at varying levels of severity, in many other disorders.These findings mean that DSM, like other medical disease classifications, should accommo-date ways to introduce dimensional approaches to mental disorders, including dimensionsthat cut across current categories. Such an approach should permit a more accurate descriptionof patient presentations and increase the validity of a diagnosis (i.e., the degree to which diag-nostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of an underlying psychopathologicaldisorder). DSM-5 is designed to better fill the need of clinicians, patients, families, and re-searchers for a clear and concise description of each mental disorder organized by explicit di-agnostic criteria, supplemented, when appropriate, by dimensional measures that crossdiagnostic boundaries, and a brief digest of information about the diagnosis, risk factors, as-sociated features, research advances, and various expressions of the disorder. 
Clinical training and experience are needed to use DSM for determining a diagnosis. Thediagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, cognitive functions, personality traits, phys-ical signs, syndrome combinations, and durations that require clinical expertise to differenti-ate from normal life variation and transient responses to stress. To facilitate a thorough56Introductionexamination of the range of symptoms present, DSM can serve clinicians as a guide to identifythe most prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder. Althoughsome mental disorders may have well-defined boundaries around symptom clusters, scien-tific evidence now places many, if not most, disorders on a spectrum with closely related dis-orders that have shared symptoms, shared genetic and environmental risk factors, andpossibly shared neural substrates (perhaps most strongly established for a subset of anxietydisorders by neuroimaging and animal models). In short, we have come to recognize that theboundaries between disorders are more porous than originally perceived.Many health profession and educational groups have been involved in the developmentand testing of DSM-5, including physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors,epidemiologists, statisticians, neuroscientists, and neuropsychologists. Finally, patients, fam-ilies, lawyers, consumer organizations, and advocacy groups have all participated in revisingDSM-5 by providing feedback on the mental disorders described in this volume. Their moni-toring of the descriptions and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding, reducestigma, and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these conditions.A Brief HistoryThe APA first published a predecessor of DSM in 1844, as a statistical classification of in-stitutionalized mental patients. It was designed to improve communication about thetypes of patients cared for in these hospitals. This forerunner to DSM also was used as acomponent of the full U.S. census. After World War II, DSM evolved through four majoreditions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists, other physicians, andother mental health professionals that described the essential features of the full range ofmental disorders. The current edition, DSM-5, builds on the goal of its predecessors (mostrecently, DSM-IV-TR, or Text Revision, published in 2000) of providing guidelines for di-agnoses that can inform treatment and management decisions. 
DSM-5 Revision ProcessIn 1999, the APA launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of DSM based onemerging research that did not support the boundaries established for some mental disor-ders. This effort was coordinated with the World Health Organization (WHO) Division ofMental Health, the World Psychiatric Association, and the National Institute of MentalHealth (NIMH) in the form of several conferences, the proceedings of which were publishedin 2002 in a monograph entitled A Research Agenda for DSM-V. Thereafter, from 2003 to 2008,a cooperative agreement with the APA and the WHO was supported by the NIMH, the Na-tional Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alco-hol Abuse (NIAAA) to convene 13 international DSM-5 research planning conferences,involving 400 participants from 39 countries, to review the world literature in specific diag-nostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both DSM-5 and the International Classi-fication of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11). Reports from these conferences formed the basisfor future DSM-5 Task Force reviews and set the stage for the new edition of DSM.In 2006, the APA named David J. Kupfer, M.D., as Chair and Darrel A. Regier, M.D.,M.P.H., as Vice-Chair of the DSM-5 Task Force. They were charged with recommendingchairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and additional task force members with a multi-disciplinary range of expertise who would oversee the development of DSM-5. An addi-tional vetting process was initiated by the APA Board of Trustees to disclose sources ofincome and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and work group members. The fulldisclosure of all income and research grants from commercial sources, including the phar-maceutical industry, in the previous 3 years, the imposition of an income cap from all com-mercial sources, and the publication of disclosures on a Web site set a new standard for theIntroduction7field. Thereafter, the task force of 28 members was approved in 2007, and appointments ofmore than 130 work group members were approved in 2008. More than 400 additionalwork group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the pro-cess. A clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorderswas central to the efforts of the task force and the work groups. This vision emerged as thetask force and work groups recounted the history of DSM-IV’s classification, its currentstrengths and limitations, and strategic directions for its revision. An intensive 6-year pro-cess involved conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses, publishing researchreports in scientific journals, developing draft diagnostic criteria, posting preliminarydrafts on the DSM-5 Web site for public comment, presenting preliminary findings at pro-fessional meetings, performing field trials, and revising criteria and text. 
Proposals for Revisions 
Proposals for the revision of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were developed by members of thework groups on the basis of rationale, scope of change, expected impact on clinical man-agement and public health, strength of the supporting research evidence, overall clarity,and clinical utility. Proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria; the addition ofnew disorders, subtypes, and specifiers; and the deletion of existing disorders. 
In the proposals for revisions, strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no-sology were first identified. Novel scientific findings over the previous two decades wereconsidered, leading to the creation of a research plan to assess potential changes throughliterature reviews and secondary data analyses. Four principles guided the draft revisions:1) DSM-5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians, and revisions mustbe feasible for routine clinical practice; 2) recommendations for revisions should be guidedby research evidence; 3) where possible, continuity should be maintained with previouseditions of DSM; and 4) no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of changebetween DSM-IV and DSM-5. 
Building on the initial literature reviews, work groups identified key issues withintheir diagnostic areas. Work groups also examined broader methodological concerns,such as the presence of contradictory findings within the literature; development of a re-fined definition of mental disorder; cross-cutting issues relevant to all disorders; and therevision of disorders categorized in DSM-IV as “not otherwise specified.” Inclusion of aproposal for revision in Section II was informed by consideration of its advantages anddisadvantages for public health and clinical utility, the strength of the evidence, and themagnitude of the change. New diagnoses and disorder subtypes and specifiers were sub-ject to additional stipulations, such as demonstration of reliability (i.e., the degree to whichtwo clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient). Dis-orders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered for deletion. Placementof cond it ions in “Cond it ions for Further Study” in Sect ion III was cont ingent on theamount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis, diagnostic reliability or valid-ity, presence of clear clinical need, and potential benefit in advancing research.DSM-5 Field TrialsThe use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a noteworthy improvement in-troduced in DSM-III. The design and implementation strategy of the DSM-5 Field Trials rep-resent several changes over approaches used for DSM-III and DSM-IV, particularly inobtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates (a statistical measure that assesseslevel of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates)in the context of clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity. For DSM-5, fieldtrials were extended by using two distinctive designs: one in large, diverse medical-academicsettings, and the other in routine clinical practices. The former capitalized on the need for largesample sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a8Introductionvariety of patient populations; the latter supplied valuable information about how proposedrevisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a diverse sample of DSM users. It isanticipated that future clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the re-vised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disor-ders (including those now being explored by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative).The medical-academic field trials were conducted at 11 North American medical-academicsites and assessed the reliability, feasibility, and clinical utility of select revisions, with prioritygiven to those that represented the greatest degree of change from DSM-IV or those potentiallyhaving the greatest public health impact. The full clinical patient populations coming to eachsite were screened for DSM-IV diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to predict several spe-cific DSM-5 disorders of interest. Stratified samples of four to seven specific disorders, plus astratum containing a representative sample of all other diagnoses, were identified for each site.Patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a clinical interview by a cli-nician blind to the diagnosis, followed by a second interview with a clinician blind to previousdiagnoses. Patients first filled out a computer-assisted inventory of cross-cutting symptoms inmore than a dozen psychological domains. These inventories were scored by a central server,and results were provided to clinicians before they conducted a typical clinical interview (withno structured protocol). Clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying criteria ona computer-assisted DSM-5 diagnostic checklist, determine diagnoses, score the severity of thediagnosis, and submit all data to the central Web-based server. This study design allowed thecalculation of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a diagnosis (us-ing the intraclass kappa statistic) and the agreement of a single patient or two different clini-cians on two separate ratings of cross-cutting symptoms, personality traits, disability, anddiagnostic severity measures (using intraclass correlation coefficients) along with informationon the precision of these estimates of reliability. It was also possible to assess the prevalencerates of both DSM-IV and DSM-5 conditions in the respective clinical populations.The routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of individual psychiatristsand other mental health clinicians. A volunteer sample was recruited that included gener-alist and specialty psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors,marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice psychiatric mental health nurses.The field trials provided exposure of the proposed DSM-5 diagnoses and dimensional mea-sures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility. 
Public and Professional ReviewIn 2010, the APA launched a unique Web site to facilitate public and professional input intoDSM-5. All draft diagnostic criteria and proposed changes in organization were posted onwww.dsm5.org for a 2-month comment period. Feedback totaled more than 8,000 submis-sions, which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work groups, whose members,where appropriate, integrated questions and comments into discussions of draft revisionsand plans for field trial testing. After revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposedchapter organization, a second posting occurred in 2011. Work groups considered feedbackfrom both Web postings and the results of the DSM-5 Field Trials when drafting proposedfinal criteria, which were posted on the Web site for a third and final time in 2012. Thesethree iterations of external review produced more than 13,000 individually signed com-ments on the Web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups, plus thousandsof organized petition signers for and against some proposed revisions, all of which allowedthe task force to actively address concerns of DSM users, as well as patients and advocacygroups, and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority.Expert ReviewThe members of the 13 work groups, representing expertise in their respective areas, col-laborated with advisors and reviewers under the overall direction of the DSM-5 TaskIntroduction9Force to draft the diagnostic criteria and accompanying text. This effort was supported bya team of APA Division of Research staff and developed through a network of text coor-dinators from each work group. The preparation of the text was coordinated by the texteditor, working in close collaboration with the work groups and under the direction of thetask force chairs. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) was established to provide a sci-entific peer review process that was external to that of the work groups. The SRC chair,vice-chair, and six committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to whichthe proposed changes from DSM-IV could be supported with scientific evidence. Eachproposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of evidence for change pre-pared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organizedaround validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria (i.e., antecedent validators such asfamilial aggregation, concurrent validators such as biological markers, and prospectivevalidators such as response to treatment or course of illness). The submissions were re-viewed by the SRC and scored according to the strength of the supportive scientific data.Other justifications for change, such as those arising from clinical experience or need orfrom a conceptual reframing of diagnostic categories, were generally seen as outside thepurview of the SRC. The reviewers’ scores, which varied substantially across the differentproposals, and an accompanying brief commentary were then returned to the APA Boardof Trustees and the work groups for consideration and response.The Clinical and Public Health Committee (CPHC), composed of a chair, vice-chair, andsix members, was appointed to consider additional clinical utility, public health, and log-ical clarification issues for criteria that had not yet accumulated the type or level of evi-dence deemed sufficient for change by the SRC. This review process was particularlyimportant for DSM-IV disorders with known deficiencies for which proposed remedieshad neither been previously considered in the DSM revision process nor been subjected toreplicated research studies. These selected disorders were evaluated by four to five exter-nal reviewers, and the blinded results were reviewed by CPHC members, who in turnmade recommendations to the APA Board of Trustees and the work groups. 
Forensic reviews by the members of the APA Council on Psychiatry and Law were con-ducted for disorders frequently appearing in forensic environments and ones with highpotential for influencing civil and criminal judgments in courtroom settings. Work groupsalso added forensic experts as advisors in pertinent areas to complement expertise pro-vided by the Council on Psychiatry and Law. 
The work groups themselves were charged with the responsibility to review the entire re-search literature surrounding a diagnostic area, including old, revised, and new diagnostic cri-teria, in an intensive 6-year review process to assess the pros and cons of making either smalliterative changes or major conceptual changes to address the inevitable reification that occurswith diagnostic conceptual approaches that persist over several decades. Such changes in-cluded the merger of previously separate diagnostic areas into more dimensional spectra, suchas that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder, substance use disorders, sexual dys-functions, and somatic symptom and related disorders. Other changes included correctingflaws that had become apparent over time in the choice of operational criteria for some disor-ders. These types of changes posed particular challenges to the SRC and CPHC review pro-cesses, which were not constructed to evaluate the validity of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.However, the DSM-5 Task Force, which had reviewed proposed changes and had responsi-bility for reviewing the text describing each disorder contemporaneously with the workgroups during this period, was in a unique position to render an informed judgment on the sci-entific merits of such revisions. Furthermore, many of these major changes were subject to fieldtrial testing, although comprehensive testing of all proposed changes could not be accommo-dated by such testing because of time limitations and availability of resources.A final recommendation from the task force was then provided to the APA Board ofTrustees and the APA Assembly’s Committee on DSM-5 to consider some of the clinicalutility and feasibility features of the proposed revisions. The assembly is a deliberative10Introductionbody of the APA representing the district branches and wider membership that is com-posed of psychiatrists from throughout the United States who provide geographic, prac-tice size, and interest-based diversity. The Committee on DSM-5 is a committee made upof a diverse group of assembly leaders.Following all of the preceding review steps, an executive “summit committee” sessionwas held to consolidate input from review and assembly committee chairs, task forcechairs, a forensic advisor, and a statistical advisor, for a preliminary review of each disor-der by the assembly and APA Board of Trustees executive committees. This preceded apreliminary review by the full APA Board of Trustees. The assembly voted, in November2012, to recommend that the board approve the publication of DSM-5, and the APA Boardof Trustees approved its publication in December 2012. The many experts, reviewers, andadvisors who contributed to this process are listed in the Appendix.Organizational StructureThe individual disorder definitions that constitute the operationalized sets of diagnosticcriteria provide the core of DSM-5 for clinical and research purposes. These criteria havebeen subjected to scientific review, albeit to varying degrees, and many disorders have un-dergone field testing for interrater reliability. In contrast, the classification of disorders (theway in which disorders are grouped, which provides a high-level organization for the man-ual) has not generally been thought of as scientifically significant, despite the fact that judg-ments had to be made when disorders were initially divided into chapters for DSM-III.DSM is a medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a historically deter-mined cognitive schema imposed on clinical and scientific information to increase its com-prehensibility and utility. Not surprisingly, as the foundational science that ultimately ledto DSM-III has approached a half-century in age, challenges have begun to emerge for cli-nicians and scientists alike that are inherent in the DSM structure rather than in the de-scription of any single disorder. These challenges include high rates of comorbidity withinand across DSM chapters, an excessive use of and need to rely on “not otherwise specified”(NOS) criteria, and a growing inability to integrate DSM disorders with the results of ge-netic studies and other scientific findings. 
As the APA and the WHO began to plan their respective revisions of the DSM and theInternational Classification of Disorders (ICD), both considered the possibility of improvingclinical utility (e.g., by helping to explain apparent comorbidity) and facilitating scientificinvestigation by rethinking the organizational structures of both publications in a linearsystem designated by alphanumeric codes that sequence chapters according to some ra-tional and relational structure. It was critical to both the DSM-5 Task Force and the WHOInternational Advisory Group on the revision of the ICD-10 Section on Mental and Behav-ioral Disorders that the revisions to the organization enhance clinical utility and remainwithin the bounds of well-replicated scientific information. Although the need for reformseemed apparent, it was important to respect the state of the science as well as the chal-lenge that overly rapid change would pose for the clinical and research communities. Inthat spirit, revision of the organization was approached as a conservative, evolutionary di-agnostic reform that would be guided by emerging scientific evidence on the relationshipsbetween disorder groups. By reordering and regrouping the existing disorders, the re-vised structure is meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives and to encourage research-ers to identify the psychological and physiological cross-cutting factors that are not boundby strict categorical designations. 
The use of DSM criteria has the clear virtue of creating a common language for com-munication between clinicians about the diagnosis of disorders. The official criteria anddisorders that were determined to have accepted clinical applicability are located in Sec-tion II of the manual. However, it should be noted that these diagnostic criteria and theirIntroduction11relationships within the classification are based on current research and may need to bemodified as new evidence is gathered by future research both within and across the do-mains of proposed disorders. “Conditions for Further Study,” described in Section III, arethose for which we determined that the scientific evidence is not yet available to supportwidespread clinical use. These diagnostic criteria are included to highlight the evolutionand direction of scientific advances in these areas to stimulate further research. 
With any ongoing review process, especially one of this complexity, different viewpointsemerge, and an effort was made to consider various viewpoints and, when warranted, ac-commodate them. For example, personality disorders are included in both Sections II andIII. Section II represents an update of the text associated with the same criteria found inDSM-IV-TR, whereas Section III includes the proposed research model for personality dis-order diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and PersonalityDisorders Work Group. As this field evolves, it is hoped that both versions will serve clin-ical practice and research initiatives.Harmonization With ICD-11The groups tasked with revising the DSM and ICD systems shared the overarching goal ofharmonizing the two classifications as much as possible, for the following reasons: 
• The existence of two major classifications of mental disorders hinders the collection anduse of national health statistics, the design of clinical trials aimed at developing newtreatments, and the consideration of global applicability of the results by internationalregulatory agencies.• More broadly, the existence of two classifications complicates attempts to replicate sci-entific results across national boundaries. 
• Even when the intention was to identify identical patient populations, DSM-IV andICD-10 diagnoses did not always agree.Early in the course of the revisions, it became apparent that a shared organizationalstructure would help harmonize the classifications. In fact, the use of a shared frameworkhelped to integrate the work of DSM and ICD work groups and to focus on scientific is-sues. The DSM-5 organization and the proposed linear structure of the ICD-11 have beenendorsed by the leadership of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project as con-sistent with the initial overall structure of that project.Of course, principled disagreements on the classification of psychopathology and onspecific criteria for certain disorders were expected given the current state of scientificknowledge. However, most of the salient differences between the DSM and the ICD classi-fications do not reflect real scientific differences, but rather represent historical by-productsof independent committee processes. 
To the surprise of participants in both revision processes, large sections of the contentfell relatively easily into place, reflecting real strengths in some areas of the scientific lit-erature, such as epidemiology, analyses of comorbidity, twin studies, and certain other ge-netically informed designs. When disparities emerged, they almost always reflected theneed to make a judgment about where to place a disorder in the face of incomplete—or,more often, conflicting—data. Thus, for example, on the basis of patterns of symptoms, co-morbidity, and shared risk factors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) wasplaced with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the same data also supported strong ar-guments to place ADHD within disruptive , impulse-control , and conduct disorders .These issues were settled with the preponderance of evidence (most notably validators ap-proved by the DSM-5 Task Force). The work groups recognize, however, that future dis-coveries might change the placement as well as the contours of individual disorders and,furthermore, that the simple and linear organization that best supports clinical practice12Introductionmay not fully capture the complexity and heterogeneity of mental disorders. The revisedorganization is coordinated with the mental and behavioral disorders chapter (Chapter V)of ICD-11, which will utilize an expanded numeric–alphanumeric coding system. How-ever, the official coding system in use in the United States at the time of publication of thismanual is that of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifica-tion (ICD-9-CM)—the U.S. adaptation of ICD-9. International Classification of Diseases, TenthRevision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), adapted from ICD-10, is scheduled for imple-mentation in the United States in October 2014. Given the impending release of ICD-11, itwas decided that this iteration, and not ICD-10, would be the most relevant on which to focusharmonization. However, given that adoption of the ICD-9-CM coding system will remainat the time of the DSM-5 release, it will be necessary to use the ICD-9-CM codes. Further-more, given that DSM-5’s organizational structure reflects the anticipated structure ofICD-11, the eventual ICD-11 codes will follow the sequential order of diagnoses in theDSM-5 chapter structure more closely. At present, both the ICD-9-CM and the ICD-10-CMcodes have been indicated for each disorder. These codes will not be in sequential orderthroughout the manual because they were assigned to complement earlier organizationalstructures.Dimensional Approach to DiagnosisStructural problems rooted in the basic design of the previous DSM classification, con-structed of a large number of narrow diagnostic categories, have emerged in both clinicalpractice and research. Relevant evidence comes from diverse sources, including studies ofcomorbidity and the substantial need for not otherwise specified diagnoses, which repre-sent the majority of diagnoses in areas such as eating disorders, personality disorders, andautism spectrum disorder. Studies of both genetic and environmental risk factors, whetherbased on twin designs, familial transmission, or molecular analyses, also raise concernsabout the categorical structure of the DSM system. Because the previous DSM approachconsidered each diagnosis as categorically separate from health and from other diagnoses,it did not capture the widespread sharing of symptoms and risk factors across many dis-orders that is apparent in studies of comorbidity. Earlier editions of DSM focused on ex-cluding false-positive results from diagnoses; thus, its categories were overly narrow, as isapparent from the widespread need to use NOS diagnoses. Indeed, the once plausible goalof identifying homogeneous populations for treatment and research resulted in narrow di-agnostic categories that did not capture clinical reality, symptom heterogeneity within dis-orders, and significant sharing of symptoms across multiple disorders. The historicalaspiration of achieving diagnostic homogeneity by progressive subtyping within disordercategories no longer is sensible; like most common human ills, mental disorders are het-erogeneous at many levels, ranging from genetic risk factors to symptoms. 
Related to recommendations about alterations in the chapter structure of DSM-5, mem-bers of the diagnostic spectra study group examined whether scientific validators couldinform possible new groupings of related disorders within the existing categorical frame-work. Eleven such indicators were recommended for this purpose: shared neural sub-strates, family traits, genetic risk factors, specific environmental risk factors, biomarkers,temperamental antecedents, abnormalities of emotional or cognitive processing, symptomsimilarity, course of illness, high comorbidity, and shared treatment response. These indi-cators served as empirical guidelines to inform decision making by the work groups andthe task force about how to cluster disorders to maximize their validity and clinical utility. 
A series of papers was developed and published in a prominent international journal(Psychological Medicine, Vol. 39, 2009) as part of both the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 develop-mental processes to document that such validators were most useful for suggesting largegroupings of disorders rather than for “validating” individual disorder diagnostic criteria.The regrouping of mental disorders in DSM-5 is intended to enable future research to en-Introduction13hance understanding of disease origins and pathophysiological commonalities betweendisorders and provide a base for future replication wherein data can be reanalyzed overtime to continually assess validity. Ongoing revisions of DSM-5 will make it a “living doc-ument,” adaptable to future discoveries in neurobiology, genetics, and epidemiology.On the basis of the published findings of this common DSM-5 and ICD-11 analysis, itwas demonstrated that clustering of disorders according to what has been termed internal-izing and externalizing factors represents an empirically supported framework. Within boththe internalizing group (representing disorders with prominent anxiety, depressive, andsomatic symptoms) and the externalizing group (representing disorders with prominentimpulsive, disruptive conduct, and substance use symptoms), the sharing of genetic andenvironmental risk factors, as shown by twin studies, likely explains much of the system-atic comorbidities seen in both clinical and community samples. The adjacent placement of“internalizing disorders,” characterized by depressed mood, anxiety, and related physio-logical and cognitive symptoms, should aid in developing new diagnostic approaches, in-cluding dimensional approaches, while facilitating the identification of biological markers.Similarly, adjacencies of the “externalizing group,” including disorders exhibiting antiso-cial behaviors, conduct disturbances, addictions, and impulse-control disorders, should en-courage advances in identifying diagnoses, markers, and underlying mechanisms.Despite the problem posed by categorical diagnoses, the DSM-5 Task Force recognizedthat it is premature scientifically to propose alternative definitions for most disorders. Theorganizational structure is meant to serve as a bridge to new diagnostic approaches with-out disrupting current clinical practice or research. With support from DSM-associatedtraining materials, the National Institutes of Health other funding agencies, and scientificpublications, the more dimensional DSM-5 approach and organizational structure can fa-cilitate research across current diagnostic categories by encouraging broad investigationswithin the proposed chapters and across adjacent chapters. Such a reformulation of re-search goals should also keep DSM-5 central to the development of dimensional approachesto diagnosis that will likely supplement or supersede current categorical approaches incoming years.Developmental and Lifespan ConsiderationsTo improve clinical utility, DSM-5 is organized on developmental and lifespan consider-ations. It begins with diagnoses thought to reflect developmental processes that manifestearly in life (e.g., neurodevelopmental and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychoticdisorders) , followed by diagnoses that more commonly manifest in ado lescence andyoung adulthood (e.g., bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders), and ends with diagno-ses relevant to adulthood and later life (e.g., neurocognitive disorders). A similar approachhas been taken, where possible, within each chapter. This organizational structure facili-tates the comprehensive use of lifespan information as a way to assist in diagnostic deci-sion making. 
The proposed organization of chapters of DSM-5, after the neurodevelopmental disor-ders, is based on groups of internalizing (emotional and somatic) disorders, externalizingdisorders, neurocognitive disorders, and other disorders. It is hoped that this organizationwill encourage further study of underlying pathophysiological processes that give rise todiagnostic comorbidity and symptom heterogeneity. Furthermore, by arranging disorderclusters to mirror clinical reality, DSM-5 should facilitate identification of potential diag-noses by non–mental health specialists, such as primary care physicians. 
The organizational structure of DSM-5, along with ICD harmonization, is designed toprovide better and more flexible diagnostic concepts for the next epoch of research and toserve as a useful guide to clinicians in explaining to patients why they might have receivedmultiple diagnoses or why they might have received additional or altered diagnoses overtheir lifespan.14IntroductionCultural IssuesMental disorders are defined in relation to cultural, social, and familial norms and values.Culture provides interpretive frameworks that shape the experience and expression of thesymptoms, signs, and behaviors that are criteria for diagnosis. Culture is transmitted, re-vised, and recreated within the family and other social systems and institutions. Diagnosticassessment must therefore consider whether an individual’s experiences, symptoms, andbehaviors differ from sociocultural norms and lead to difficulties in adaptation in the cul-tures of origin and in specific social or familial contexts. Key aspects of culture relevant to di-agnostic classification and assessment have been considered in the development of DSM-5.In Section III, the “Cultural Formulation” contains a detailed discussion of culture anddiagnosis in DSM-5, including tools for in-depth cultural assessment. In the Appendix, the“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” provides a description of some common cul-tural syndromes, idioms of distress, and causal explanations relevant to clinical practice.The boundaries between normality and pathology vary across cultures for specific typesof behaviors. Thresholds of tolerance for specific symptoms or behaviors differ across cul-tures, social settings, and families. Hence, the level at which an experience becomes prob-lematic or pathological will differ. The judgment that a given behavior is abnormal andrequires clinical attention depends on cultural norms that are internalized by the individualand applied by others around them, including family members and clinicians. Awareness ofthe significance of culture may correct mistaken interpretations of psychopathology, but cul-ture may also contribute to vulnerability and suffering (e.g., by amplifying fears that main-tain panic disorder or health anxiety). Cultural meanings, habits, and traditions can alsocontribute to either stigma or support in the social and familial response to mental illness.Culture may provide coping strategies that enhance resilience in response to illness, or sug-gest help seeking and options for accessing health care of various types, including alterna-tive and complementary health systems. Culture may influence acceptance or rejection of adiagnosis and adherence to treatments, affecting the course of illness and recovery. Culturealso affects the conduct of the clinical encounter; as a result, cultural differences between theclinician and the patient have implications for the accuracy and acceptance of diagnosis aswell as for treatment decisions, prognostic considerations, and clinical outcomes.Historically, the construct of the culture-bound syndrome has been a key interest ofcultural psychiatry. In DSM-5, this construct has been replaced by three concepts that offergreater clinical utility: 
1. Cultural syndrome is a cluster or group of co-occurring, relatively invariant symptomsfound in a specific cultural group, community, or context (e.g., ataque de nervios). Thesyndrome may or may not be recognized as an illness within the culture (e.g., it mightbe labeled in various ways), but such cultural patterns of distress and features of illnessmay nevertheless be recognizable by an outside observer. 
2. Cultural idiom of distress is a linguistic term, phrase, or way of talking about sufferingamong individuals of a cultural group (e.g., similar ethnicity and religion) referring toshared concepts of pathology and ways of expressing, communicating, or naming es-sential features of distress (e.g., kufungisisa). An idiom of distress need not be associatedwith specific symptoms, syndromes, or perceived causes. It may be used to convey awide range of discomfort, including everyday experiences, subclinical conditions, orsuffering due to social circumstances rather than mental disorders. For example, mostcultures have common bodily idioms of distress used to express a wide range of suf-fering and concerns.3. Cultural explanation or perceived cause is a label, attribution, or feature of an explanatorymodel that provides a culturally conceived etiology or cause for symptoms, illness, ordistress (e.g., maladi moun). Causal explanations may be salient features of folk classi-fications of disease used by laypersons or healers. 
Introduction15These three concepts (for which discussion and examples are provided in Section IIIand the Appendix) suggest cultural ways of understanding and describing illness experi-ences that can be elicited in the clinical encounter. They influence symptomatology, helpseeking, clinical presentations, expectations of treatment, illness adaptation, and treat-ment response. The same cultural term often serves more than one of these functions. 
Gender DifferencesSex and gender differences as they relate to the causes and expression of medical conditionsare established for a number of diseases, including selected mental disorders. Revisions toDSM-5 included review of potential differences between men and women in the expressionof mental illness. In terms of nomenclature, sex differences are variations attributable to anindividual’s reproductive organs and XX or XY chromosomal complement. Gender differ-ences are variations that result from biological sex as well as an individual’s self-represen-tat ion that inc ludes the psycho log ica l , behav iora l , and soc ia l consequences o f one ’sperceived gender. The term gender differences is used in DSM-5 because, more commonly,the differences between men and women are a result of both biological sex and individualself-representation. However, some of the differences are based on only biological sex. 
Gender can influence illness in a variety of ways. First, it may exclusively determinewhether an individual is at risk for a disorder (e.g., as in premenstrual dysphoric disor-der). Second, gender may moderate the overall risk for development of a disorder asshown by marked gender differences in the prevalence and incidence rates for selectedmental disorders. Third, gender may influence the likelihood that particular symptoms ofa disorder are experienced by an individual. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder isan example of a disorder with differences in presentation that are most commonly expe-rienced by boys or girls. Gender likely has other effects on the experience of a disorder thatare indirectly relevant to psychiatric diagnosis. It may be that certain symptoms are morereadily endorsed by men or women, and that this contributes to differences in service pro-vision (e.g., women may be more likely to recognize a depressive, bipolar, or anxiety dis-order and endorse a more comprehensive list of symptoms than men). 
Reproductive life cycle events, including estrogen variations, also contribute to genderdifferences in risk and expression of illness. Thus, a specifier for postpartum onset of maniaor major depressive episode denotes a time frame wherein women may be at increased riskfor the onset of an illness episode. In the case of sleep and energy, alterations are often nor-mative postpartum and thus may have lower diagnostic reliability in postpartum women. 
The manual is configured to include information on gender at multiple levels. If thereare gender-specific symptoms, they have been added to the diagnostic criteria. A gender-related specifier, such as perinatal onset of a mood episode, provides additional informa-tion on gender and diagnosis. Finally, other issues that are pertinent to diagnosis and gen-der considerations can be found in the section “Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.”Use of Other Specified and Unspecified DisordersTo enhance diagnostic specificity, DSM-5 replaces the previous NOS designation with twooptions for clinical use: other specified disorder and unspecified disorder. The other specifieddisorder category is provided to allow the clinician to communicate the specific reasonthat the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific category within a diagnos-tic class. This is done by recording the name of the category, followed by the specific rea-son . For example , for an ind iv idua l w ith c l in ica l ly significant depress ive symptomslasting 4 weeks but whose symptomatology falls short of the diagnostic threshold for amajor depressive episode, the clinician would record “other specified depressive disorder,depressive episode with insufficient symptoms.” If the clinician chooses not to specify the16Introductionreason that the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, then “unspecified depressivedisorder” would be diagnosed. Note that the differentiation between other specified andunspecified disorders is based on the clinician’s decision, providing maximum flexibilityfor diagnosis. Clinicians do not have to differentiate between other specified and unspec-ified disorders based on some feature of the presentation itself. When the clinician deter-mines that there is evidence to specify the nature of the clinical presentation, the otherspecified diagnosis can be given. When the clinician is not able to further specify and de-scribe the clinical presentation, the unspecified diagnosis can be given. This is left entirelyup to clinical judgment.For a more detailed discussion of how to use other specified and unspecified designa-tions, see “Use of the Manual” in Section I.The Multiaxial SystemDespite widespread use and its adoption by certain insurance and governmental agencies,the multiaxial system in DSM-IV was not required to make a mental disorder diagnosis. Anonaxial assessment system was also included that simply listed the appropriate Axis I, II,and III disorders and conditions without axial designations. DSM-5 has moved to a nonax-ial documentation of diagnosis (formerly Axes I, II, and III), with separate notations forimportant psychosocial and contextual factors (formerly Axis IV) and disability (formerlyAxis V). This revision is consistent with the DSM-IV text that states, “The multiaxial dis-tinction among Axis I, Axis II, and Axis III disorders does not imply that there are funda-mental differences in their conceptual ization , that mental disorders are unrelated tophysical or biological factors or processes, or that general medical conditions are unrelatedto behavioral or psychosocial factors or processes.” The approach of separately noting di-agnosis from psychosocial and contextual factors is also consistent with established WHOand ICD guidance to consider the individual’s functional status separately from his or herdiagnoses or symptom status. In DSM-5, Axis III has been combined with Axes I and II.Clinicians should continue to list medical conditions that are important to the understand-ing or management of an individual’s mental disorder(s).DSM-IV Axis IV covered psychosocial and environmental problems that may affect thediagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders. Although this axis providedhelpful information, even if it was not used as frequently as intended, the DSM-5 TaskForce recommended that DSM-5 should not develop its own classification of psychosocialand environmental problems, but rather use a selected set of the ICD-9-CM V codes andthe new Z codes contained in ICD-10-CM. The ICD-10 Z codes were examined to deter-mine which are most relevant to mental disorders and also to identify gaps. 
DSM-IV Axis V consisted of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, repre-senting the clinician's judgment of the individual’s overall level of “functioning on a hy-pothetical continuum of mental health–illness.” It was recommended that the GAF bedropped from DSM-5 for several reasons, including its conceptual lack of clarity (i.e., in-cluding symptoms, suicide risk, and disabilities in its descriptors) and questionable psy-chometrics in routine practice. In order to provide a global measure of disability, the WHODisability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is included, for further study, in Section III ofDSM-5 (see the chapter “Assessment Measures”). The WHODAS is based on the Interna-tional Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) for use across all of medicineand health care. The WHODAS (version 2.0), and a modification developed for children/adolescents and their parents by the Impairment and Disability Study Group were in-cluded in the DSM-5 field trial.Introduction17Online EnhancementsIt was challenging to determine what to include in the print version of DSM-5 to be mostclinically relevant and useful and at the same time maintain a manageable size. For thisreason, the inclusion of clinical rating scales and measures in the print edition is limited tothose considered most relevant. Additional assessment measures used in the field trialsare available online (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5), linked to the relevant disorders. TheCultural Formulation Interview, Cultural Formulation Interview—Informant Version, andsupplementary modules to the core Cultural Formulation Interview are also available on-line at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.DSM-5 is available as an online subscription at PsychiatryOnline.org as well as an e-book. The online component contains modules and assessment tools to enhance the diag-nostic criteria and text. Also available online is a complete set of supportive references aswell as additional helpful information. The organizational structure of DSM-5, its use ofdimensional measures, and compatibility with ICD codes will allow it to be readily adapt-able to future scientific discoveries and refinements in its clinical utility. DSM-5 will be an-alyzed over time to continually assess its validity and enhance its value to clinicians.This page intentionally left blank 
Use of the ManualThe introduction contains much of the history and developmental process of theDSM-5 revision. This section is designed to provide a practical guide to using DSM-5, par-ticularly in clinical practice. The primary purpose of DSM-5 is to assist trained cliniciansin the diagnosis of their patients’ mental disorders as part of a case formulation assess-ment that leads to a fully informed treatment plan for each individual. The symptoms con-tained in the respective diagnostic criteria sets do not constitute comprehensivedefinitions of underlying disorders, which encompass cognitive, emotional, behavioral,and physiological processes that are far more complex than can be described in these briefsummaries. Rather, they are intended to summarize characteristic syndromes of signs andsymptoms that point to an underlying disorder with a characteristic developmental his-tory, biological and environmental risk factors, neuropsychological and physiological cor-relates, and typical clinical course.Approach to Clinical Case FormulationThe case formulation for any given patient must involve a careful clinical history and con-cise summary of the social, psychological, and biological factors that may have contrib-uted to developing a given mental disorder. Hence, it is not sufficient to simply check offthe symptoms in the diagnostic criteria to make a mental disorder diagnosis. Although asystematic check for the presence of these criteria as they apply to each patient will assurea more reliable assessment, the relative severity and valence of individual criteria andtheir contribution to a diagnosis require clinical judgment. The symptoms in our diagnos-tic criteria are part of the relatively limited repertoire of human emotional responses to in-ternal and external stresses that are generally maintained in a homeostatic balance withouta disruption in normal functioning. It requires clinical training to recognize when the com-bination of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors has resultedin a psychopathological condition in which physical signs and symptoms exceed normalranges. The ultimate goal of a clinical case formulation is to use the available contextualand diagnostic information in developing a comprehensive treatment plan that is in-formed by the individual’s cultural and social context. However, recommendations for theselection and use of the most appropriate evidence-based treatment options for each dis-order are beyond the scope of this manual.Although decades of scientific effort have gone into developing the diagnostic criteriasets for the disorders included in Section II, it is well recognized that this set of categoricaldiagnoses does not fully describe the full range of mental disorders that individuals ex-perience and present to clinicians on a daily basis throughout the world. As noted previ-ously in the introduction, the range of genetic/environmental interactions over the courseof human development affecting cognitive, emotional and behavioral function is virtuallylimitless. As a result, it is impossible to capture the full range of psychopathology in thecategorical diagnostic categories that we are now using. Hence, it is also necessary to in-clude “other specified/unspecified” disorder options for presentations that do not fitexactly into the diagnostic boundaries of disorders in each chapter. In an emergency de-partment setting, it may be possible to identify only the most prominent symptom ex-pressions associated with a particular chapter—for example, delusions, hallucinations,1920Use of the Manualmania, depression, anxiety, substance intoxication, or neurocognitive symptoms—so thatan “unspecified” disorder in that category is identified until a fuller differential diagnosisis possible.Definition of a Mental DisorderEach disorder identified in Section II of the manual (excluding those in the chapters enti-tled “Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medica-tion” and “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”) must meet thedefinition of a mental disorder. Although no definition can capture all aspects of all dis-orders in the range contained in DSM-5, the following elements are required:A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant distur-bance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflectsa dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes un-derlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with signif-icant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities.An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss,such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant be-havior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily be-tween the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the devianceor conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it should help cliniciansto determine prognosis, treatment plans, and potential treatment outcomes for their pa-tients. However, the diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treat-ment . Need for treatment is a comp lex clinical decision that takes into cons iderationsymptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal ideation), the patient’sdistress (mental pain) associated with the symptom(s), disability related to the patient’ssymptoms, risks and benefits of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatricsymptoms complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter individuals whosesymptoms do not meet full criteria for a mental disorder but who demonstrate a clear needfor treatment or care. The fact that some individuals do not show all symptoms indicativeof a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to appropriate care.Approaches to validating diagnostic criteria for discrete categorical mental disordershave included the following types of evidence: antecedent validators (similar genetic mark-ers, family traits, temperament, and environmental exposure), concurrent validators (simi-lar neural substrates , biomarkers , emotional and cognitive processing, and symptomsimilarity), and predictive validators (similar clinical course and treatment response). InDSM-5, we recognize that the current diagnostic criteria for any single disorder will not nec-essarily identify a homogeneous group of patients who can be characterized reliably with allof these validators. Available evidence shows that these validators cross existing diagnosticboundaries but tend to congregate more frequently within and across adjacent DSM-5 chap-ter groups. Until incontrovertible etiological or pathophysiological mechanisms are identi-fied to fully validate specific disorders or disorder spectra, the most important standard forthe DSM-5 disorder criteria will be their clinical utility for the assessment of clinical courseand treatment response of individuals grouped by a given set of diagnostic criteria.This definition of mental disorder was developed for clinical, public health, and re-search purposes. Additional information is usually required beyond that contained in theDSM-5 diagnostic criteria in order to make legal judgments on such issues as criminal re-sponsibility, eligibility for disability compensation, and competency (see “CautionaryStatement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” elsewhere in this manual).Use of the Manual21Criterion for Clinical SignificanceThere have been substantial efforts by the DSM-5 Task Force and the World Health Orga-nization (WHO) to separate the concepts of mental disorder and disability (impairment insocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning). In the WHO system, the In-ternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) covers all diseases and disorders, while the In-ternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a separateclassification of global disability. The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS)is based on the ICF and has proven useful as a standardized measure of disability for men-tal disorders. However, in the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful mea-surements of severity for many mental disorders, it has not been possible to completelyseparate normal and pathological symptom expressions contained in diagnostic criteria.This gap in information is particularly problematic in clinical situations in which the pa-tient’s symptom presentation by itself (particularly in mild forms) is not inherently path-o log ica l and may be encoun te red in ind iv idua l s fo r whom a d iagno s is o f “men ta ldisorder” would be inappropriate. Therefore, a generic diagnostic criterion requiring dis-tress or disability has been used to establish disorder thresholds, usually worded “the dis-turbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning.” The text following the revised definition of a mentaldisorder acknowledges that this criterion may be especially helpful in determining a pa-tient’s need for treatment. Use of information from family members and other third parties(in addition to the individual) regarding the individual’s performance is recommendedwhen necessary.Elements of a DiagnosisDiagnostic Criteria and DescriptorsDiagnostic criteria are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses, and their use should beinformed by clinical judgment. Text descriptions, including introductory sections of eachdiagnostic chapter, can help support diagnosis (e.g., providing differential diagnoses; de-scribing the criteria more fully under “Diagnostic Features”). 
Following the assessment of diagnostic criteria, clinicians should consider the applica-tion of disorder subtypes and/or specifiers as appropriate. Severity and course specifiersshould be applied to denote the individual’s current presentation, but only when the fullcriteria are met. When full criteria are not met, clinicians should consider whether thesymptom presentation meets criteria for an “other specified” or “unspecified” designa-tion. Where applicable, specific criteria for defining disorder severity (e.g., mild, moder-ate, severe, extreme), descriptive features (e.g., with good to fair insight; in a controlledenvironment), and course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission, recurrent) are pro-vided with each diagnosis. On the basis of the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria,and clinician judgment, a final diagnosis is made.The general convention in DSM-5 is to allow multiple diagnoses to be assigned forthose presentations that meet criteria for more than one DSM-5 disorder.Subtypes and SpecifiersSubtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded in the fourth, fifth, or sixth digit) areprovided for increased specificity. Subtypes define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaus-tive phenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruc-tion “Specify whether” in the criteria set . In contrast , specifiers are not intended to bemutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a consequence, more than one specifiermay be given. Specifiers are indicated by the instruction “Specify” or “Specify if” in the cri-teria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of22Use of the Manualindividuals with the disorder who share certain features (e.g., major depressive disorder,with mixed features) and to convey information that is relevant to the management of theindividual’s disorder, such as the “with other medical comorbidity” specifier in sleep-wake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype or specifier(e.g., 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with be-havioral disturbance) or severity (296.21 [F32.0] major depressive disorder, single episode,mild), the majority of subtypes and specifiers included in DSM-5 cannot be coded withinthe ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM systems and are indicated only by including the subtype orspecifier after the name of the disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder [social phobia], per-formance type). Note that in some cases, a specifier or subtype is codable in ICD-10-CMbut not in ICD-9-CM. Accordingly, in some cases the 4th or 5th character codes for the sub-types or specifiers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM coding designations.A DSM-5 diagnosis is usually applied to the individual’s current presentation; previ-ous diagnoses from which the individual has recovered should be clearly noted as such.Specifiers indicating course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission) may be listed afterthe diagnosis and are indicated in a number of criteria sets. Where available, severity spec-ifiers are provided to guide clinicians in rating the intensity, frequency, duration, symptomcount, or other severity indicator of a disorder. Severity specifiers are indicated by the in-struction “Specify current severity” in the criteria set and include disorder-specific defini-tions. Descriptive features specifiers have also been provided in the criteria set and conveyadditional information that can inform treatment planning (e.g., obsessive-compulsivedisorder, with poor insight). Not all disorders include course, severity, and/or descriptivefeatures specifiers. 
Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other 
Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical AttentionIn addition to important psychosocial and environmental factors (see “The Multiaxial Sys-tem” in the “Introduction” elsewhere in this manual), these chapters in Section II also con-tain other conditions that are not mental disorders but may be encountered by mentalhealth clinicians. These conditions may be listed as a reason for clinical visit in addition to,or in place of, the mental disorders listed in Section II. A separate chapter is devoted tomedication-induced disorders and other adverse effects of medication that may be as-sessed and treated by clinicians in mental health practice such as akathisia, tardive dyski-nesia, and dystonia. The description of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is expanded fromthat provided in DSM-IV-TR to highlight the emergent and potentially life-threatening na-ture of this condition, and a new entry on antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is pro-vided. An additional chapter discusses other conditions that may be a focus of clinicalattention. These include relational problems, problems related to abuse and neglect, prob-lems with adherence to treatment regimens, obesity, antisocial behavior, and malingering.Principal DiagnosisWhen more than one diagnosis for an individual is given in an inpatient setting, the prin-cipal diagnosis is the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occa-sioning the admission of the individual. When more than one diagnosis is given for anindividual in an outpatient setting, the reason for visit is the condition that is chiefly re-sponsible for the ambulatory care medical services received during the visit. In most cases,the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is also the main focus of attention or treat-ment. It is often difficult (and somewhat arbitrary) to determine which diagnosis is theprincipal diagnosis or the reason for visit, especially when, for example, a substance-related diagnosis such as alcohol use disorder is accompanied by a non-substance-relateddiagnosis such as schizophrenia. For example, it may be unclear which diagnosis shouldUse of the Manual23be considered “principal” for an individual hospitalized with both schizophrenia and al-cohol use disorder, because each condition may have contributed equally to the need foradmission and treatment. The principal diagnosis is indicated by listing it first, and the re-maining disorders are listed in order of focus of attention and treatment. When the prin-cipal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder due to another medical condition(e.g., major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, psychotic disorder due tomalignant lung neoplasm), ICD coding rules require that the etiological medical conditionbe listed first. In that case, the principal diagnosis or reason for visit would be the mentaldisorder due to the medical condition, the second listed diagnosis. In most cases, the dis-order listed as the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed by the qualifyingphrase “(principal diagnosis)” or “(reason for visit).”Provisional DiagnosisThe specifier “provisional” can be used when there is a strong presumption that the fullcriteria will ultimately be met for a disorder but not enough information is available tomake a firm diagnosis. The clinician can indicate the diagnostic uncertainty by recording“(provisional)” following the diagnosis. For example, this diagnosis might be used whenan individual who appears to have a major depressive disorder is unable to give an ade-quate history, and thus it cannot be established that the full criteria are met. Another use ofthe term provisional is for those situations in which differential diagnosis depends exclu-sively on the duration of illness. For example, a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder re-quires a duration of less than 6 months but of at least 1 month and can only be givenprovisionally if assigned before remission has occurred.Coding and Reporting ProceduresEach disorder is accompanied by an identifying diagnostic and statistical code, which istypically used by institutions and agencies for data collection and billing purposes. Thereare specific recording protocols for these diagnostic codes (identified as coding notes inthe text) that were established by WHO, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser-vices (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center forHealth Statistics to ensure consistent international recording of prevalence and mortalityrates for identified health conditions. For most clinicians, the codes are used to identify thediagnosis or reason for visit for CMS and private insurance service claims. The officialcoding system in use in the United States as of publication of this manual is ICD-9-CM. Of-ficial adoption of ICD-10-CM is scheduled to take place on October 1, 2014, and thesecodes, which are shown parenthetically in this manual, should not be used until the offi-cial implementation occurs. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes have been listed 1) pre-ceding the name of the disorder in the classification and 2) accompanying the criteria setfor each disorder. For some diagnoses (e.g., neurocognitive and substance/medication-induced disorders), the appropriate code depends on further specification and is listedwithin the criteria set for the disorder, as coding notes, and, in some cases, further clarifiedin a section on recording procedures. The names of some disorders are followed by alter-native terms enclosed in parentheses, which, in most cases, were the DSM-IV names forthe disorders.Looking to the Future:Assessment and Monitoring ToolsThe various components of DSM-5 are provided to facilitate patient assessment and to aidin developing a comprehensive case formulation. Whereas the diagnostic criteria in Sec-tion II are well-established measures that have undergone extensive review, the assess-24Use of the Manualment tools, a cultural formulation interview, and conditions for further study included inSection III are those for which we determined that the scientific evidence is not yet avail-able to support widespread clinical use. These diagnostic aids and criteria are included tohighlight the evolution and direction of scientific advances in these areas and to stimulatefurther research.Each of the measures in Section III is provided to aid in a comprehensive assessment ofindividuals that will contribute to a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to the individ-ual presentation and clinical context. Where cultural dynamics are particularly importantfor diagnostic assessment, the cultural formulation interview should be considered as auseful aid to communication with the individual. Cross-cutting symptom and diagnosis-specific severity measures provide quantitative ratings of important clinical areas that aredesigned to be used at the initial evaluation to establish a baseline for comparison with rat-ings on subsequent encounters to monitor changes and inform treatment planning.The use of such measures will undoubtedly be facilitated by digital applications, andthe measures are included in Section III to provide for further evaluation and develop-ment. As with each DSM edition, the diagnostic criteria and the DSM-5 classification ofmental disorders reflect the current consensus on the evolving knowledge in our field.Cautionary Statement forForensic Use of DSM-5Although the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and text are primarily designed to assistclinicians in conducting clinical assessment, case formulation, and treatment planning,DSM-5 is also used as a reference for the courts and attorneys in assessing the forensic con-sequences of mental disorders. As a result, it is important to note that the definition ofmental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to meet the needs of clinicians, publichealth professionals, and research investigators rather than all of the technical needs of thecourts and legal professionals. It is also important to note that DSM-5 does not providetreatment guidelines for any given disorder.When used appropriately, diagnoses and diagnostic information can assist legal deci-sion makers in their determinations. For example, when the presence of a mental disorderis the predicate for a subsequent legal determination (e.g., involuntary civil commitment),the use of an established system of diagnosis enhances the value and reliability of the de-termination. By providing a compendium based on a review of the pertinent clinical andresearch literature, DSM-5 may facilitate legal decision makers’ understanding of the rel-evant characteristics of mental disorders. The literature related to diagnoses also serves asa check on ungrounded speculation about mental disorders and about the functioning of aparticular individual. Finally, diagnostic information about longitudinal course may im-prove decision making when the legal issue concerns an individual’s mental functioningat a past or future point in time.However, the use of DSM-5 should be informed by an awareness of the risks and lim-itations of its use in forensic settings. When DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual descrip-tions are employed for forensic purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic information will bemisused or misunderstood. These dangers arise because of the imperfect fit between thequestions of ultimate concern to the law and the information contained in a clinical diagno-sis. In most situations, the clinical diagnosis of a DSM-5 mental disorder such as intellec-tual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), schizophrenia, major neurocognitivedisorder, gambling disorder, or pedophilic disorder does not imply that an individualwith such a condition meets legal criteria for the presence of a mental disorder or a speci-fied legal standard (e.g., for competence, criminal responsibility, or disability). For the latter,additional information is usually required beyond that contained in the DSM-5 diagnosis,which might include information about the individual’s functional impairments and howthese impairments affect the particular abilities in question. It is precisely because impair-ments, abilities, and disabilities vary widely within each diagnostic category that assign-ment of a particular diagnosis does not imply a specific level of impairment or disability.Use of DSM-5 to assess for the presence of a mental disorder by nonclinical, nonmed-ical, or otherwise insufficiently trained individuals is not advised. Nonclinical decisionmakers should also be cautioned that a diagnosis does not carry any necessary implica-tions regarding the etiology or causes of the individual’s mental disorder or the individ-ual’s degree of control over behaviors that may be associated with the disorder. Evenwhen diminished control over one’s behavior is a feature of the disorder, having the diag-nosis in itself does not demonstrate that a particular individual is (or was) unable to con-trol his or her behavior at a particular time.25This page intentionally left blank

This section contains the diagnostic criteria approved for routine clinicaluse along with the ICD-9-CM codes (ICD-10 codes are shown parenthetically).For each mental disorder, the diagnostic criteria are followed by descriptivetext to assist in diagnostic decision making. Where needed, specific recordingprocedures are presented with the diagnostic criteria to provide guidance inselecting the most appropriate code. In some cases, separate recording pro-cedures for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM are provided. Although not consideredas official DSM-5 disorders, medication-induced movement disorders and otheradverse effects of medication, as well as other conditions that may be a focusof clinical attention (including additional ICD-9-CM V codes and forthcomingICD-10-CM Z codes), are provided to indicate other reasons for a clinical visitsuch as environmental factors and relational problems. These codes are adaptedfrom ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and were neither reviewed nor approved asofficial DSM-5 diagnoses, but can provide additional context for a clinical for-mulation and treatment plan. These three components—the criteria and theirdescriptive text, the medication-induced movement disorders and other ad-verse effects of medication, and the descriptions of other conditions that maybe a focus of clinical attention—represent the key elements of the clinical di-agnostic process and thus are presented together.This page intentionally left blank 
NeurodevelopmentalDisordersThe neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions with onset in thedevelopmental period. The disorders typically manifest early in development, often be-fore the child enters grade school, and are characterized by developmental deficits thatproduce impairments of personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. Therange of developmental deficits varies from very specific limitations of learning or controlof executive functions to global impairments of social skills or intelligence. The neurode-velopmental disorders frequently co-occur; for example, individuals with autism spec-trum disorder often have intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), andmany children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have a specificlearning disorder. For some disorders, the clinical presentation includes symptoms of ex-cess as well as deficits and delays in achieving expected milestones. For example, autismspectrum disorder is diagnosed only when the characteristic deficits of social communi-cation are accompanied by excessively repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and insis-tence on sameness. 
Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is characterized by deficitsin general mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking,judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. The deficits result in impair-ments of adaptive functioning, such that the individual fails to meet standards of personalindependence and social responsibility in one or more aspects of daily life, including com-munication, social participation, academic or occupational functioning, and personal inde-pendence at home or in community settings. Global developmental delay, as its nameimplies, is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestonesin several areas of intellectual functioning. The diagnosis is used for individuals who areunable to undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including childrenwho are too young to participate in standardized testing. Intellectual disability may resultfrom an acquired insult during the developmental period from, for example, a severe headinjury, in which case a neurocognitive disorder also may be diagnosed.The communication disorders include language disorder, speech sound disorder, so-cial (pragmatic) communication disorder, and childhood-onset fluency disorder (stutter-ing). The first three disorders are characterized by deficits in the development and use oflanguage, speech, and social communication, respectively. Childhood-onset fluency dis-order is characterized by disturbances of the normal fluency and motor production ofspeech, including repetitive sounds or syllables, prolongation of consonants or vowelsounds, broken words, blocking, or words produced with an excess of physical tension.Like other neurodevelopmental disorders, communication disorders begin early in lifeand may produce lifelong functional impairments.Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social communica-tion and social interaction across multiple contexts, including deficits in social reciprocity,nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and skills in developing,maintaining, and understanding relationships. In addition to the social communicationdeficits, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder requires the presence of restricted, re-petitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Because symptoms change with de-velopment and may be masked by compensatory mechanisms, the diagnostic criteria may3132Neurodevelopmental Disordersbe met based on historical information, although the current presentation must cause sig-nificant impairment.Within the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, individual clinical characteristicsare noted through the use of specifiers (with or without accompanying intellectual impair-ment; with or without accompanying structural language impairment; associated with aknown medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition; associated with anotherneurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder), as well as specifiers that describethe autistic symptoms (age at first concern; with or without loss of established skills; sever-ity). These specifiers provide clinicians with an opportunity to individualize the diagnosisand communicate a richer clinical description of the affected individuals. For example, manyindividuals previously diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder would now receive a diagnosisof autism spectrum disorder without language or intellectual impairment.ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of inattention, dis-organization, and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. Inattention and disorganization entail inabil-ity to stay on task, seeming not to listen, and losing materials, at levels that are inconsistentwith age or developmental level. Hyperactivity-impulsivity entails overactivity, fidgeting, in-ability to stay seated, intruding into other people’s activities, and inability to wait—symptomsthat are excessive for age or developmental level. In childhood, ADHD frequently overlapswith disorders that are often considered to be “externalizing disorders,” such as oppositionaldefiant disorder and conduct disorder. ADHD often persists into adulthood, with resultantimpairments of social, academic and occupational functioning.The neurodevelopmental motor disorders include developmental coordination disor-der, stereotypic movement disorder, and tic disorders. Developmental coordination dis-order is characterized by deficits in the acquisition and execution of coordinated motorskills and is manifested by clumsiness and slowness or inaccuracy of performance of mo-tor skills that cause interference with activities of daily living. Stereotypic movement dis-order is diagnosed when an individual has repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparentlypurposeless motor behaviors, such as hand flapping, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, or hitting. The movements interfere with social, academic, or other activities. If thebehaviors cause self-injury, this should be specified as part of the diagnostic description.Tic disorders are characterized by the presence of motor or vocal tics, which are sudden,rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic, sterotyped motor movements or vocalizations. The dura-tion, presumed etiology, and clinical presentation define the specific tic disorder that is di-agnosed: Tourette’s disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, provisionaltic disorder, other specified tic disorder, and unspecified tic disorder. Tourette’s disorderis diagnosed when the individual has multiple motor and vocal tics that have been presentfor at least 1 year and that have a waxing-waning symptom course.Specific learning disorder, as the name implies, is diagnosed when there are specific defi-cits in an individual’s ability to perceive or process information efficiently and accurately. Thisneurodevelopmental disorder first manifests during the years of formal schooling and ischaracterized by persistent and impairing difficulties with learning foundational academicskills in reading, writing, and/or math. The individual’s performance of the affected academicskills is well below average for age, or acceptable performance levels are achieved only withextraordinary effort. Specific learning disorder may occur in individuals identified as intellec-tually gifted and manifest only when the learning demands or assessment procedures (e.g.,timed tests) pose barriers that cannot be overcome by their innate intelligence and compensa-tory strategies. For all individuals, specific learning disorder can produce lifelong impairmentsin activities dependent on the skills, including occupational performance.The use of specifiers for the neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses enriches the clin-ical description of the individual’s clinical course and current symptomatology. In addi-tion to specifiers that describe the clinical presentation, such as age at onset or severityratings, the neurodevelopmental disorders may include the specifier “associated with aknown medical or genetic condition or environmental factor.” This specifier gives clini-Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)33cians an opportunity to document factors that may have played a role in the etiology of thedisorder, as well as those that might affect the clinical course. Examples include geneticdisorders, such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Rett syndrome; medical con-ditions such as epilepsy; and environmental factors, including very low birth weight andfetal alcohol exposure (even in the absence of stigmata of fetal alcohol syndrome).Intellectual DisabilitiesIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)Diagnostic CriteriaIntellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset duringthe developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficitsin conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:A. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstractthinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed byboth clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and socio-cultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongo-ing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life,such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multipleenvironments, such as home, school, work, and community.C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.Note: The diagnostic term intellectual disability is the equivalent term for the ICD-11 diag-nosis of intellectual developmental disorders. Although the term intellectual disability isused throughout this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify relationships withother classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the United States (Public Law111-256, Rosa’s Law) replaces the term mental retardation with intellectual disability, andresearch journals use the term intellectual disability. Thus, intellectual disability is theterm in common use by medical, educational, and other professions and by the lay publicand advocacy groups.Specify current severity (see Table 1): 
317 (F70)    Mild318.0 (F71) Moderate318.1 (F72) Severe318.2 (F73) ProfoundSpecifiersThe various levels of severity are defined on the basis of adaptive functioning, and not IQscores, because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of supports required.Moreover, IQ measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range.

Conceptual domainSocial domainPractical domainCompared with typically developing age-mates, the individual is immature in social 
interactions. For example, there may be diffi-culty in accurately perceiving peers’ social 
cues. Communication, conversation, and lan-guage are more concrete or immature than 
expected for age. There may be difficulties reg-ulating emotion and behavior in age-appropri-ate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by 
peers in social situations. There is limited 
understanding of risk in social situations; 
social judgment is immature for age, and 
the person is at risk of being manipulated 
by others (gullibility).The individual may function age-appropriately in 
personal care. Individuals need some support with 
complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In 
adulthood, supports typically involve grocery shop-ping, transportation, home and child-care organiz-ing, nutritious food preparation, and banking and 
money management. Recreational skills resemble 
those of age-mates, although judgment related to 
well-being and organization around recreation 
requires support. In adulthood, competitive 
employment is often seen in jobs that do not empha-size conceptual skills. Individuals generally need 
support to make health care decisions and legal 
decisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation 
competently. Support is typically needed to raise a 
family.For preschool children, there 
may be no obvious conceptual 
differences. For school-age 
children and adults, there are 
difficulties in learning aca-demic skills involving reading, 
writing, arithmetic, time, or 
money, with support needed 
in one or more areas to meet 
age-related expectations. In 
adults, abstract thinking, exec-utive function (i.e., planning, 
strategizing, priority setting, 
and cognitive flexibility), and 
short-term memory, as well as 
functional use of academic 
skills (e.g., reading, money 
management), are impaired. 
There is a somewhat concrete 
approach to problems and 
solutions compared with 
age-mates. 
34NeurodevleopmentalDisordersTABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) (continued)Severity 
levelConceptual domainSocial domainPractical domainModerate All through development, the 
individual’s conceptual skills 
lag markedly behind those of 
peers. For preschoolers, lan-guage and pre-academic skills 
develop slowly. For school-age 
children, progress in reading, 
writing, mathematics, and 
understanding of time and 
money occurs slowly across 
the school years and is mark-edly limited compared with 
that of peers. For adults, aca-demic skill development is 
typically at an elementary 
level, and support is required 
for all use of academic skills in 
work and personal life. Ongo-ing assistance on a daily basis 
is needed to complete concep-tual tasks of day-to-day life, 
and others may take over these 
responsibilities fully for the 
individual.The individual shows marked differences from 
peers in social and communicative behavior 
across development. Spoken language is typi-cally a primary tool for social communication 
but is much less complex than that of peers. 
Capacity for relationships is evident in ties to 
family and friends, and the individual may 
have successful friendships across life and 
sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. 
However, individuals may not perceive or 
interpret social cues accurately. Social judg-ment and decision-making abilities are lim-ited, and caretakers must assist the person 
with life decisions. Friendships with typically 
developing peers are often affected by com-munication or social limitations. Significant 
social and communicative support is needed 
in work settings for success. 
The individual can care for personal needs involving 
eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an 
adult, although an extended period of teaching and 
time is needed for the individual to become indepen-dent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. 
Similarly, participation in all household tasks can be 
achieved by adulthood, although an extended 
period of teaching is needed, and ongoing supports 
will typically occur for adult-level performance. 
Independent employment in jobs that require lim-ited conceptual and communication skills can be 
achieved, but considerable support from co-work-ers, supervisors, and others is needed to manage 
social expectations, job complexities, and ancillary 
responsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, 
health benefits, and money management. A variety 
of recreational skills can be developed. These typi-cally require additional supports and learning 
opportunities over an extended period of time. 
Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant 
minority and causes social problems.IntellectualDisability(IntellectualDevleopmentalDisorder)35TABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) (continued)Conceptual domainSocial domainPractical domainSeverity 
levelSevereAttainment of conceptual skills 
is limited. The individual gen-erally has little understanding 
of written language or of con-cepts involving numbers, 
quantity, time, and money. 
Caretakers provide extensive 
supports for problem solving 
throughout life. 
Profound Conceptual skills generally 
involve the physical world 
rather than symbolic pro-cesses. The individual may use 
objects in goal-directed fashion 
for self-care, work, and recre-ation. Certain visuospatial 
skills, such as matching and 
sorting based on physical char-acteristics, may be acquired. 
However, co-occurring motor 
and sensory impairments may 
prevent functional use of 
objects. 
Spoken language is quite limited in terms of 
vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be sin-gle words or phrases and may be supple-mented through augmentative means. Speech 
and communication are focused on the here 
and now within everyday events. Language is 
used for social communication more than for 
explication. Individuals understand simple 
speech and gestural communication. Relation-ships with family members and familiar others 
are a source of pleasure and help. 
The individual has very limited understanding 
of symbolic communication in speech or ges-ture. He or she may understand some simple 
instructions or gestures. The individual 
expresses his or her own desires and emotions 
largely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic com-munication. The individual enjoys relation-ships with well-known family members, 
caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates 
and responds to social interactions through 
gestural and emotional cues. Co-occurring 
sensory and physical impairments may pre-vent many social activities. 
The individual requires support for all activities of 
daily living, including meals, dressing, bathing, and 
elimination. The individual requires supervision at 
all times. The individual cannot make responsible 
decisions regarding well-being of self or others. In 
adulthood, participation in tasks at home, recre-ation, and work requires ongoing support and assis-tance. Skill acquisition in all domains involves long-term teaching and ongoing support. Maladaptive 
behavior, including self-injury, is present in a signif-icant minority. 
The individual is dependent on others for all aspects of 
daily physical care, health, and safety, although he or 
she may be able to participate in some of these activi-ties as well. Individuals without severe physical 
impairments may assist with some daily work tasks at 
home, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple actions 
with objects may be the basis of participation in some 
vocational activities with high levels of ongoing sup-port. Recreational activities may involve, for example, 
enjoyment in listening to music, watching movies, 
going out for walks, or participating in water activi-ties, all with the support of others. Co-occurring 
physical and sensory impairments are frequent 
barriers to participation (beyond watching) in home, 
recreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive 
behavior is present in a significant minority.36NeurodevleopmentalDisordersIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)37Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) aredeficits in general mental abilities (Criterion A) and impairment in everyday adaptivefunctioning, in comparison to an individual’s age-, gender-, and socioculturally matchedpeers (Criterion B). Onset is during the developmental period (Criterion C). The diagnosisof intellectual disability is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing ofintellectual and adaptive functions.Criterion A refers to intellectual functions that involve reasoning, problem solving,planning, abstract thinking , judgment, learning from instruction and experience, andpractical understanding. Critical components include verbal comprehension, workingmemory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, and cognitive ef-ficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically measured with individually administered andpsychometrically valid, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, psychometrically soundtests of intelligence. Individuals with intellectual disability have scores of approximatelytwo standard deviations or more below the population mean, including a margin for mea-surement error (generally +5 points). On tests with a standard deviation of 15 and a meanof 100, this involves a score of 65–75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are requiredto interpret test results and assess intellectual performance.Factors that may affect test scores include practice effects and the “Flynn effect’ (i.e.,overly high scores due to out-of-date test norms). Invalid scores may result from the use ofbrief intelligence screening tests or group tests; highly discrepant individual subtest scoresmay make an overall IQ score invalid. Instruments must be normed for the individual’s so-ciocultural background and native language. Co-occurring disorders that affect communi-cation, language, and/or motor or sensory function may affect test scores. Individualcognitive profiles based on neuropsychological testing are more useful for understandingintellectual abilities than a single IQ score. Such testing may identify areas of relativestrengths and weaknesses, an assessment important for academic and vocational planning.IQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient toassess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks. For example, a per-son with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe adaptive behavior problems in socialjudgment, social understanding, and other areas of adaptive functioning that the person’sactual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score. Thus, clinicaljudgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.Deficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a person meets communitystandards of personal independence and social responsibility, in comparison to others of sim-ilar age and sociocultural background. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning inthree domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic) domain involvescompetence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practicalknowledge, problem solving, and judgment in novel situations, among others. The social do-main involves awareness of others’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy; interper-sonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social judgment, among others. Thepractical domain involves learning and self-management across life settings, including personalcare, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of behavior, andschool and work task organization, among others. Intellectual capacity, education, motivation,socialization, personality features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexistinggeneral medical conditions or mental disorders influence adaptive functioning.Adaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized,culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound measures. Standardized measures areused with knowledgeable informants (e.g., parent or other family member; teacher; coun-selor; care provider) and the individual to the extent possible. Additional sources of infor-mation include educational, developmental, medical, and mental health evaluations.Scores from standardized measures and interview sources must be interpreted using clin-ical judgment. When standardized testing is difficult or impossible, because of a variety of38Neurodevelopmental Disordersfactors (e.g., sensory impairment, severe problem behavior), the individual may be diag-nosed with unspecified intellectual disability. Adaptive functioning may be difficult toassess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative in-formation reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.Criterion B is met when at least one domain of adaptive functioning—conceptual, so-cial, or practical—is sufficiently impaired that ongoing support is needed in order for theperson to perform adequately in one or more life settings at school, at work, at home, or inthe community. To meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability, the deficits in adap-tive functioning must be directly related to the intellectual impairments described in Cri-terion A. Criterion C, onset during the developmental period, refers to recognition thatintellectual and adaptive deficits are present during childhood or adolescence.Associated Features Supporting DiagnosisIntellectual disability is a heterogeneous condition with multiple causes. There may beassociated difficulties with social judgment; assessment of risk; self-management of behav-ior, emotions, or interpersonal relationships; or motivation in school or work environments.Lack of communication skills may predispose to disruptive and aggressive behaviors. Gull-ibility is often a feature, involving naiveté in social situations and a tendency for being easilyled by others. Gullibility and lack of awareness of risk may result in exploitation by othersand possible victimization, fraud, unintentional criminal involvement, false confessions,and risk for physical and sexual abuse. These associated features can be important in crim-inal cases, including Atkins-type hearings involving the death penalty.Individuals with a diagnosis of intellectual disability with co-occurring mental disor-ders are at risk for suicide. They think about suicide, make suicide attempts, and may diefrom them. Thus, screening for suicidal thoughts is essential in the assessment process. Be-cause of a lack of awareness of risk and danger, accidental injury rates may be increased.PrevalenceIntellectual disability has an overall general population prevalence of approximately 1%,and prevalence rates vary by age. Prevalence for severe intellectual disability is approxi-mately 6 per 1,000.Development and CourseOnset of intellectual disability is in the developmental period. The age and characteristicfeatures at onset depend on the etiology and severity of brain dysfunction. Delayed motor,language, and social milestones may be identifiable within the first 2 years of life amongthose with more severe intellectual disability, while mild levels may not be identifiable un-til school age when difficulty with academic learning becomes apparent. All criteria (in-cluding Criterion C) must be fulfilled by history or current presentation. Some childrenunder age 5 years whose presentation will eventually meet criteria for intellectual disabil-ity have deficits that meet criteria for global developmental delay.When intellectual disability is associated with a genetic syndrome, there may be a char-acteristic physical appearance (as in , e.g., Down syndrome). Some syndromes have abehavioral phenotype, which refers to specific behaviors that are characteristic of particulargenetic disorder (e .g . , Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) . In acqu ired forms , the onset may beabrupt following an illness such as meningitis or encephalitis or head trauma occurringduring the developmental period. When intellectual disability results from a loss of pre-viously acquired cognitive skills, as in severe traumatic brain injury, the diagnoses of in-tellectual disability and of a neurocognitive disorder may both be assigned.Although intellectual disability is generally nonprogressive, in certain genetic disor-ders (e.g., Rett syndrome) there are periods of worsening, followed by stabilization, and inIntellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)39others (e.g., San Phillippo syndrome) progressive worsening of intellectual function. Afterearly childhood, the disorder is generally lifelong, although severity levels may changeover time. The course may be influenced by underlying medical or genetic conditions andco-occurring conditions (e.g., hearing or visual impairments, epilepsy). Early and ongoing in-terventions may improve adaptive functioning throughout childhood and adulthood. Insome cases, these result in significant improvement of intellectual functioning, such thatthe diagnosis of intellectual disability is no longer appropriate. Thus, it is common practicewhen assessing infants and young children to delay diagnosis of intellectual disability un-til after an appropriate course of intervention is provided. For older children and adults,the extent of support provided may allow for full participation in all activities of daily liv-ing and improved adaptive function. Diagnostic assessments must determine whether im-proved adaptive skills are the result of a stable, generalized new skill acquisition (in whichcase the diagnosis of intellectual disability may no longer be appropriate) or whether theimprovement is contingent on the presence of supports and ongoing interventions (inwhich case the diagnosis of intellectual disability may still be appropriate).Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. Prena ta l e t io log ies inc lude gene tic syndromes (e .g . , se -quence variations or copy number variants involving one or more genes; chromosomaldisorders), inborn errors of metabolism, brain malformations, maternal disease (includingplacental disease), and environmental influences (e.g., alcohol, other drugs, toxins, terato-gens). Perinatal causes include a variety of labor and delivery-related events leading toneonatal encephalopathy. Postnatal causes include hypoxic ischemic injury, traumaticbrain injury, infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders (e.g., infantile spasms),severe and chronic social deprivation, and toxic metabolic syndromes and intoxications(e.g., lead, mercury).Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Intellectual disability occurs in all races and cultures. Cultural sensitivity and knowledgeare needed during assessment, and the individual’s ethnic, cultural, and linguistic back-ground, available experiences, and adaptive functioning within his or her community andcultural setting must be taken into account.Gender-Related Diagnostic IssuesOverall, males are more likely than females to be diagnosed with both mild (averagemale:female ratio 1.6:1) and severe (average male:female ratio 1.2:1) forms of intellectualdisability. However, gender ratios vary widely in reported studies. Sex-linked genetic fac-tors and male vulnerability to brain insult may account for some of the gender differences.Diagnostic MarkersA comprehensive evaluation includes an assessment of intellectual capacity and adaptivefunctioning; identification of genetic and nongenetic etiologies; evaluation for associatedmedical conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, seizure disorder); and evaluation for co-occurringmental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Components of the evaluation may includebasic pre- and perinatal medical history, three-generational family pedigree, physical exam-ination, genetic evaluation (e.g., karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis and testingfor specific genetic syndromes), and metabolic screening and neuroimaging assessment.Differential DiagnosisThe diagnosis of intellectual disability should be made whenever Criteria A, B, and C aremet. A diagnosis of intellectual disability should not be assumed because of a particular40Neurodevelopmental Disordersgenetic or medical condition. A genetic syndrome linked to intellectual disability shouldbe noted as a concurrent diagnosis with the intellectual disability.Major and mild neurocognitive disorders.Intellectual disability is categorized as a neu-rodevelopmental disorder and is distinct from the neurocognitive disorders, which arecharacterized by a loss of cognitive functioning. Major neurocognitive disorder may co-occur with intellectual disability (e.g., an individual with Down syndrome who developsAlzheimer’s disease, or an individual with intellectual disability who loses further cogni-tive capacity following a head injury). In such cases, the diagnoses of intellectual disabilityand neurocognitive disorder may both be given.Communication disorders and specific learning disorder. These neurodevelopmentaldisorders are specific to the communication and learning domains and do not show defi-cits in intellectual and adaptive behavior. They may co-occur with intellectual disability.Both diagnoses are made if full criteria are met for intellectual disability and a communi-cation disorder or specific learning disorder.Autism spectrum disorder.Intellectual disability is common among individuals withautism spectrum disorder. Assessment of intellectual ability may be complicated by so-cial-communication and behavior deficits inherent to autism spectrum disorder, whichmay interfere with understanding and complying with test procedures. Appropriate as-sessment of intellectual functioning in autism spectrum disorder is essential, with reas-sessment across the developmental period, because IQ scores in autism spectrum disordermay be unstable, particularly in early childhood.ComorbidityCo-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical conditions are frequentin intellectual disability, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebralpalsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population. The prognosisand outcome of co-occurring diagnoses may be influenced by the presence of intellectualdisability. Assessment procedures may require modifications because of associated disor-ders, including communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and motor, sensory,or other disorders. Knowledgeable informants are essential for identifying symptomssuch as irritability, mood dysregulation, aggression, eating problems, and sleep problems,and for assessing adaptive functioning in various community settings.The most common co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are atten-tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; anxiety disorders;autism spectrum disorder; stereotypic movement disorder (with or without self-injuriousbehavior); impulse-control disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major depres-sive disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of intellectual disability. Self-injurious behavior requires prompt diagnostic attention and may warrant a separate di-agnosis of stereotypic movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual disability, partic-ularly those with more severe intellectual disability, may also exhibit aggression anddisruptive behaviors, including harm of others or property destruction.Relationship to Other ClassificationsICD-11 (in development at the time of this publication) uses the term intellectual develop-mental disorders to indicate that these are disorders that involve impaired brain functioningearly in life. These disorders are described in ICD-11 as a metasyndrome occurring in thedevelopmental period analogous to dementia or neurocognitive disorder in later life.There are four subtypes in ICD-11: mild, moderate, severe, and profound.The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)also uses the term intellectual disability with a similar meaning to the term as used in thisGlobal Developmental Delay41manual. The AAIDD’s classification is multidimensional rather than categorical and isbased on the disability construct. Rather than listing specifiers as is done in DSM-5, theAAIDD emphasizes a profile of supports based on severity.Global Developmental Delay315.8 (F88)This diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical severitylevel cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. This category is diagnosed whenan individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellec-tual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assess-ments of intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to participate instandardized testing. This category requires reassessment after a period of time.Unspecified Intellectual Disability(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)319 (F79)This category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when assessment of thedegree of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) by means of locallyavailable procedures is rendered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory orphysical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor disability; or pres-ence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring mental disorder. This category shouldonly be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time. 
Communication DisordersDisorders of communication include deficits in language, speech, and communication.Speech is the expressive production of sounds and includes an individual’s articulation,fluency, voice, and resonance quality. Language includes the form, function, and use of aconventional system of symbols (i.e., spoken words, sign language, written words, pic-tures) in a rule-governed manner for communication. Communication includes any verbalor nonverbal behavior (whether intentional or unintentional) that influences the behavior,ideas, or attitudes of another individual. Assessments of speech, language and communi-cation abilities must take into account the individual's cultural and language context,particularly for individuals growing up in bilingual environments. The standardized mea-sures of language development and of nonverbal intellectual capacity must be relevant forthe cultural and linguistic group (i.e., tests developed and standardized for one group maynot provide appropriate norms for a different group). The diagnostic category of commu-nication disorders includes the following: language disorder, speech sound disorder,childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), social (pragmatic) communication disor-der, and other specified and unspecified communication disorders.42Neurodevelopmental DisordersDiagnostic CriteriaLanguage Disorder315.32 (F80.2)3.A. Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e.,spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or produc-tion that include the following:1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings together to formsentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology).Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to ex-plain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).B. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, re-sulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, aca-demic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.D. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dys-function, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better explained by in-tellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay.Diagnostic FeaturesThe core diagnostic features of language disorder are difficulties in the acquisition and useof language due to deficits in the comprehension or production of vocabulary, sentencestructure, and discourse. The language deficits are evident in spoken communication,written communication, or sign language. Language learning and use is dependent onboth receptive and expressive skills. Expressive ability refers to the production of vocal, ges-tural, or verbal signals, while receptive ability refers to the process of receiving and com-prehending language messages. Language skills need to be assessed in both expressiveand receptive modalities as these may differ in severity. For example, an individual’s ex-pressive language may be severely impaired, while his receptive language is hardly im-paired at all.Language disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these effects thenlimit the capacity for discourse. The child’s first words and phrases are likely to be delayedin onset ; vocabulary s ize is smaller and less varied than expected ; and sentences areshorter and less complex with grammatical errors, especially in past tense. Deficits in com-prehension of language are frequently underestimated, as children may be good at usingcontext to infer meaning. There may be word-finding problems, impoverished verbal def-initions, or poor understanding of synonyms, multiple meanings, or word play appro-priate for age and culture. Problems with remembering new words and sentences aremanifested by difficulties following instructions of increasing length, difficulties rehears-ing strings of verbal information (e.g., remembering a phone number or a shopping list),and difficulties remembering novel sound sequences, a skill that may be important forlearning new words. Difficulties with discourse are shown by a reduced ability to provideadequate information about the key events and to narrate a coherent story.The language difficulty is manifest by abilities substantially and quantifiably belowthat expected for age and significantly interfering with academic achievement, occupa-tional performance, effective communication, or socialization (Criterion B). A diagnosis oflanguage disorder is made based on the synthesis of the individual’s history, direct clinicalobservation in different contexts (i.e., home, school, or work), and scores from standard-ized tests of language ability that can be used to guide estimates of severity.Language Disorder43Associated Features Supporting DiagnosisA positive family history of language disorders is often present. Individuals, even chil-dren, can be adept at accommodating to their limited language. They may appear to be shyor reticent to talk. Affected individuals may prefer to communicate only with family mem-bers or other familiar individuals. Although these social indicators are not diagnostic of alanguage disorder, if they are notable and persistent, they warrant referral for a full lan-guage assessment. Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may co-occur withspeech sound disorder.Development and CourseLanguage acquisition is marked by changes from onset in toddlerhood to the adult level ofcompetency that appears during adolescence. Changes appear across the dimensions oflanguage (sounds , words, grammar, narratives/expository texts, and conversationalskills) in age-graded increments and synchronies. Language disorder emerges during theearly developmental period; however, there is considerable variation in early vocabularyacquisition and early word combinations, and individual differences are not, as singleindicators, highly predictive of later outcomes. By age 4 years, individual differences inlanguage ability are more stable, with better measurement accuracy, and are highly pre-dictive of later outcomes. Language disorder diagnosed from 4 years of age is likely to bestable over time and typically persists into adulthood, although the particular profile oflanguage strengths and deficits is likely to change over the course of development.Risk and Prognostic FactorsChildren with receptive language impairments have a poorer prognosis than those withpredominantly expressive impairments. They are more resistant to treatment, and diffi-culties with reading comprehension are frequently seen.Genetic and physiological. Language disorders are highly heritable, and family mem-bers are more likely to have a history of language impairment.Differential DiagnosisNormal variations in language. Language disorder needs to be distinguished from nor-mal developmental variations, and this distinction may be difficult to make before 4 yearsof age. Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of language (e.g., dialects) must beconsidered when an individual is being assessed for language impairment.Hearing or other sensory impairment. Hearing impairment needs to be excluded as theprimary cause of language difficulties. Language deficits may be associated with a hearingimpairment, other sensory deficit, or a speech-motor deficit. When language deficits are inexcess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of language disordermay be made.Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Language delay is often thepresenting feature of intellectual disability, and the definitive diagnosis may not be madeuntil the child is able to complete standardized assessments. A separate diagnosis is notgiven unless the language deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations.Neurological disorders. Language disorder can be acquired in association with neuro-logical disorders, including epilepsy (e.g., acquired aphasia or Landau-Kleffner syndrome).Language regression. Loss of speech and language in a child younger than 3 years maybe a sign of autism spectrum disorder (with developmental regression) or a specific neuro-logical condition, such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Among children older than 3 years,language loss may be a symptom of seizures, and a diagnostic assessment is necessary toexclude the presence of epilepsy (e.g., routine and sleep electroencephalogram).44ComorbidityNeurodevelopmental DisordersLanguage disorder is strongly associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders interms of specific learning disorder (literacy and numeracy), attention-deficit/hyperactiv-ity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental coordination disorder. It isalso associated with social (pragmatic) communication disorder. A positive family historyof speech or language disorders is often present.Speech Sound DisorderDiagnostic Criteria315.39 (F80.0)A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligi-bility or prevents verbal communication of messages. 
B. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with socialparticipation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or inany combination.C. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.D. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as cere-bral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medi-cal or neurological conditions. 
Diagnostic Features 
Speech sound production describes the clear articulation of the phonemes (i.e., individualsounds) that in combination make up spoken words. Speech sound production requires boththe phonological knowledge of speech sounds and the ability to coordinate the movements ofthe articulators (i.e., the jaw, tongue, and lips,) with breathing and vocalizing for speech. Chil-dren with speech production difficulties may experience difficulty with phonological knowl-edge of speech sounds or the ability to coordinate movements for speech in varying degrees.Speech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous in its underlying mechanisms and includes pho-nological disorder and articulation disorder. A speech sound disorder is diagnosed whenspeech sound production is not what would be expected based on the child’s age and devel-opmental stage and when the deficits are not the result of a physical, structural, neurological,or hearing impairment. Among typically developing children at age 4 years, overall speechshould be intelligible, whereas at age 2 years, only 50% may be understandable.Associated Features Supporting DiagnosisLanguage disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may be found to co-occur with speechsound disorder. A positive family history of speech or language disorders is often present. 
If the ability to rapidly coordinate the articulators is a particular aspect of difficulty,there may be a history of delay or incoordination in acquiring skills that also utilize thearticulators and related facial musculature; among others, these skills include chewing,maintaining mouth closure, and blowing the nose. Other areas of motor coordination maybe impaired as in developmental coordination disorder. Verbal dyspraxia is a term alsoused for speech production problems.Speech may be differentially impaired in certain genetic conditions (e.g., Down syn-drome, 22q deletion, FoxP2 gene mutation). If present, these should also be coded.Development and CourseLearning to produce speech sounds clearly and accurately and learning to produce con-nected speech fluently are developmental skills. Articulation of speech sounds follows aChildhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)45developmental pattern, which is reflected in the age norms of standardized tests. It is notunusual for typically developing children to use developmental processes for shorteningwords and syllables as they are learning to talk, but their progression in mastering speechsound production should result in mostly intelligible speech by age 3 years. Children withspeech sound disorder continue to use immature phonological simplification processespast the age when most children can produce words clearly.Most speech sounds should be produced clearly and most words should be pronouncedaccurately according to age and community norms by age 7 years. The most frequently mis-articulated sounds also tend to be learned later, leading them to be called the “late eight” (l, r,s, z, th, ch, dzh, and zh). Misarticulation of any of these sounds by itself could be consideredwithin normal limits up to age 8 years. When multiple sounds are involved, it may be appro-priate to target some of those sounds as part of a plan to improve intelligibility prior to the ageat which almost all children can produce them accurately. Lisping (i.e., misarticulating sibi-lants) is particularly common and may involve frontal or lateral patterns of airstream direc-tion. It may be associated with an abnormal tongue-thrust swallowing pattern.Most children with speech sound disorder respond well to treatment, and speech dif-ficulties improve over time, and thus the disorder may not be lifelong. However, when alanguage disorder is also present, the speech disorder has a poorer prognosis and may beassociated with specific learning disorders.Differential DiagnosisNormal variations in speech. Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of speechshould be considered before making the diagnosis.Hearing or other sensory impairment. Hearing impairment or deafness may result inabnormalities of speech. Deficits of speech sound production may be associated with ahearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a speech-motor deficit. When speech deficitsare in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of speech sounddisorder may be made.Structural deficits. Speech impairment may be due to structural deficits (e.g., cleft palate).Dysarthria. Speech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder, such as cerebralpalsy. Neurological signs, as well as distinctive features of voice, differentiate dysarthriafrom speech sound disorder, although in young children (under 3 years) differentiationmay be difficult, particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor involve-ment (as in, e.g., Worster-Drought syndrome).Selective mutism. Limited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism, an anxietydisorder that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more contexts or settings. Se-lective mutism may develop in children with a speech disorder because of embarassmentabout their impairments, but many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speechin “safe” settings, such as at home or with close friends. 
Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)Diagnostic Criteria315.35 (F80.81)A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappropri-ate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and are characterizedby frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the following: 
1. Sound and syllable repetitions.2. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.46Neurodevelopmental Disorders3. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).4. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).5. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).6. Words produced with an excess of physical tension.7. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I see him”).B. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective communica-tion, social participation, or academic or occupational performance, individually or inany combination.C. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. (Note: Later-onset casesare diagnosed as 307.0 [F98.5] adult-onset fluency disorder.)D. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency as-sociated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical con-dition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) is a disturbance inthe normal fluency and time patterning of speech that is inappropriate for the individual’sage. This disturbance is characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of soundsor syllables and by other types of speech dysfluencies, including broken words (e.g.,pauses within a word), audible or silent blocking (i.e., filled or unfilled pauses in speech),circumlocutions (i.e., word substitutions to avoid problematic words), words producedwith an excess of physical tension, and monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-Isee him”). The disturbance in fluency interferes with academic or occupational achieve-ment or with social communication. The extent of the disturbance varies from situation tosituation and often is more severe when there is special pressure to communicate (e.g., giv-ing a report at school, interviewing for a job). Dysfluency is often absent during oral read-ing, singing, or talking to inanimate objects or to pets.Associated Features Supporting DiagnosisFearful anticipation of the problem may develop. The speaker may attempt to avoid dys-fluencies by linguistic mechanisms (e .g., al tering the rate of speech, avoiding certainwords or sounds) or by avoiding certain speech situations, such as telephoning or publicspeaking. In addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety have beenshown to exacerbate dysfluency.Childhood-onset fluency disorder may also be accompanied by motor movements(e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors of the lips or face, jerking of the head, breathing movements,fist clenching). Children with fluency disorder show a range of language abilities, and therelationship between fluency disorder and language abilities is unclear.Development and CourseChildhood-onset fluency disorder, or developmental stuttering, occurs by age 6 for 80%–90% of affected individuals, with age at onset ranging from 2 to 7 years. The onset can beinsidious or more sudden. Typically, dysfluencies start gradually, with repetition of initialconsonants, first words of a phrase, or long words. The child may not be aware of dysflu-encies. As the disorder progresses, the dysfluencies become more frequent and interfering,occurring on the most meaningful words or phrases in the utterance. As the child becomesaware of the speech difficulty, he or she may develop mechanisms for avoiding the dys-fluencies and emotional responses, including avoidance of public speaking and use ofshort and simple utterances. Longitudinal research shows that 65%–85% of children re-Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder47cover from the dysfluency, with severity of fluency disorder at age 8 years predicting re-covery or persistence into adolescence and beyond.Risk and Prognostic FactorsGenetic and physiological. The risk of stuttering among first-degree biological rela-tives of individuals with childhood-onset fluency disorder is more than three times therisk in the general population.Functional Consequences of 
Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)In addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety can exacerbate dysflu-ency. Impairment of social functioning may result from this anxiety.Differential DiagnosisSensory deficits. Dysfluencies of speech may be associated with a hearing impairmentor other sensory deficit or a speech-motor deficit. When the speech dysfluencies are in ex-cess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of childhood-onset flu-ency disorder may be made.Normal speech dysfluencies. The disorder must be distinguished from normal dysflu-encies that occur frequently in young children, which include whole-word or phrase rep-etitions (e .g . , “I want , I want ice cream”) , incomplete phrases, interjections , unfilledpauses, and parenthetical remarks. If these difficulties increase in frequency or complexityas the child grows older, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder is appropriate.Medication side effects. Stuttering may occur as a side effect of medication and may bedetected by a temporal relationship with exposure to the medication.Adult-onset dysfluencies.If onset of dysfluencies is during or after adolescence, it is an“adult-onset dysfluency” rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder. Adult-onset dysflu-encies are associated with specific neurological insults and a variety of medical conditionsand mental disorders and may be specified with them, but they are not a DSM-5 diagnosis.

Social (Pragmatic) Communication DisorderDiagnostic Criteria315.39 (F80.89)2.A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as man-ifested by all of the following:1. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharinginformation, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the needs ofthe listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, talk-ing differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.3. Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns inconversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal andnonverbal signals to regulate interaction.48Neurodevelopmental Disorders4. Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences) andnonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors,multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participa-tion, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, indi-vidually or in combination.C. The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may notbecome fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited capacities).D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to lowabilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better explained byautism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder),global developmental delay, or another mental disorder.Diagnostic FeaturesSocial (pragmatic) communication disorder is characterized by a primary difficulty withpragmatics, or the social use of language and communication, as manifested by deficits inunderstanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in nat-uralistic contexts, changing language according to the needs of the listener or situation,and following rules for conversations and storytelling. The deficits in social communica-tion result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, devel-opment of social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance. Thedeficits are not better explained by low abilities in the domains of structural language orcognitive ability.Associated Features Supporting DiagnosisThe most common associated feature of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is lan-guage impairment, which is characterized by a history of delay in reaching language mile-stones, and historical, if not current, structural language problems (see “Language Disorder”earlier in this chapter). Individuals with social communication deficits may avoid social inter-actions. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral problems, and specificlearning disorders are also more common among affected individuals.Development and Course 
Because social (pragmatic) communication depends on adequate developmental progressin speech and language, diagnosis of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is rareamong children younger than 4 years. By age 4 or 5 years, most children should possessadequate speech and language abilities to permit identification of specific deficits in socialcommunication. Milder forms of the disorder may not become apparent until early ado-lescence, when language and social interactions become more complex.The outcome of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is variable, with some chil-dren improving substantially over time and others continuing to have difficulties persist-ing into adulthood. Even among those who have significant improvements, the earlydeficits in pragmatics may cause lasting impairments in social relationships and behaviorand also in acquisition of other related skills, such as written expression. 
Risk and Prognostic FactorsGenetic and physiological. A family history of autism spectrum disorder, communica-tion disorders, or specific learning disorder appears to increase the risk for social (prag-matic) communication disorder.Unspecified Communication Disorder49Differential DiagnosisAutism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is the primary diagnostic con-sideration for individuals presenting with social communication deficits. The two disor-ders can be differentiated by the presence in autism spectrum disorder of restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and their absence in social (prag-matic) communication disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may only dis-play the restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities during the earlydevelopmental period, so a comprehensive history should be obtained. Current absence ofsymptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, if the restrictedinterests and repetitive behaviors were present in the past. A diagnosis of social (prag-matic) communication disorder should be considered only if the developmental historyfails to reveal any evidence of restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or ac-tivities.Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Primary deficits of ADHD may cause impair-ments in social communication and functional limitations of effective communication, so-cial participation, or academic achievement.Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). The symptoms of social communication disor-der overlap with those of social anxiety disorder. The differentiating feature is the timingof the onset of symptoms. In social (pragmatic) communication disorder, the individualhas never had effective social communication; in social anxiety disorder, the social com-munication skills developed appropriately but are not utilized because of anxiety, fear, ordistress about social interactions.Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) and global developmentaldelay. Social communication skills may be deficient among individuals with global de-velopmental delay or intellectual disability, but a separate diagnosis is not given unlessthe social communication deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations.Unspecified Communication Disorder307.9 (F80.9)This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of communicationdisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for com-munication disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diag-nostic class. The unspecified communication disorder category is used in situations inwhich the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for com-munication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presen-tations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.50Neurodevelopmental DisordersAutism Spectrum DisorderAutism Spectrum DisorderDiagnostic Criteria299.00 (F84.0)A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple con-texts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative,not exhaustive; see text):1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal socialapproach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing ofinterests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging,for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnor-malities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use ofgestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for ex-ample, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficultiesin sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.Specify current severity:Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, re-petitive patterns of behavior (seeTable 2).B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by atleast two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaus-tive; see text):1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simplemotor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncraticphrases).Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns ofverbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficultieswith transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route oreat same food every day).3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g.,strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circum-scribed or perseverative interests).4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects ofthe environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse re-sponse to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects,visual fascination with lights or movement).Specify current severity:Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, re-petitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2).C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not becomefully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked bylearned strategies in later life). 
D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other im-portant areas of current functioning.2.Autism Spectrum Disorder51E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual devel-opmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autismspectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spec-trum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that ex-pected for general developmental level.Note: Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger’sdisorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should be given thediagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked deficits in socialcommunication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrumdisorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication disorder.Specify if:With or without accompanying intellectual impairmentWith or without accompanying language impairmentAssociated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor(Coding note: Use additional code to identify the associated medical or genetic condition.)Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder(Coding note: Use additional code[s] to identify the associated neurodevelopmental,mental, or behavioral disorder[s].)With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental dis-order, pp. 119–120, for definition) (Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 [F06.1]catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder to indicate the presence of the co-morbid catatonia.)Recording ProceduresFor autism spectrum disorder that is associated with a known medical or genetic conditionor environmental factor, or with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral dis-order, record autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, orfactor) (e.g., autism spectrum disorder associated with Rett syndrome). Severity should berecorded as level of support needed for each of the two psychopathological domains inTable 2 (e.g., “requiring very substantial support for deficits in social communication andrequiring substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors”). Specification of “withaccompanying intellectual impairment” or “without accompanying intellectual impair-ment” should be recorded next. Language impairment specification should be recordedthereafter. If there is accompanying language impairment, the current level of verbal func-tioning should be recorded (e.g., “with accompanying language impairment—no intelligi-ble speech” or “with accompanying language impairment—phrase speech”). If catatonia ispresent, record separately “catatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.”SpecifiersThe severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the current symp-tomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the recognition that severity may vary bycontext and fluctuate over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and re-stricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categoriesshould not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services; these can only bedeveloped at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets.Regarding the specifier “with or without accompanying intellectual impairment,” un-derstanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a child or adult with autism spectrumdisorder is necessary for interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal andnonverbal skill are necessary (e.g . , us ing untimed nonverbal tests to assess potentialstrengths in individuals with limited language).TABLE 2 Severity levels for autism spectrum disorderSeverity levelSocial communicationRestricted, repetitive behaviorsLevel 3 
“Requiring very substantial support”Level 2“Requiring substantial support”Level 1 
“Requiring support”Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-munication skills cause severe impairments in func-tioning, very limited initiation of social 
interactions, and minimal response to social over-tures from others. For example, a person with few 
words of intelligible speech who rarely initiates 
interaction and, when he or she does, makes 
unusual approaches to meet needs only and 
responds to only very direct social approaches.Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social com-munication skills; social impairments apparent 
even with supports in place; limited initiation of 
social interactions; and reduced or abnormal 
responses to social overtures from others. For 
example, a person who speaks simple sentences, 
whose interaction is limited to narrow special inter-ests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal com-munication.Without supports in place, deficits in social communi-cation cause noticeable impairments.Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear 
examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to 
social overtures of others. May appear to have 
decreased interest in social interactions. For example, 
a person who is able to speak in full sentences and 
engages in communication but whose to-and-fro con-versation with others fails, and whose attempts to 
make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful.Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping 
with change, or other restricted/repetitive behav-iors markedly interfere with functioning in all 
spheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus 
or action.Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with 
change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors 
appear frequently enough to be obvious to the 
casual observer and interfere with functioning 
in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty 
changing focus or action.Inflexibility of behavior causes significant interfer-ence with functioning in one or more contexts. Dif-ficulty switching between activities. Problems of 
organization and planning hamper independence.52NeurodevleopmentalDisordersAutism Spectrum Disorder53To use the specifier “with or without accompanying language impairment,” the cur-rent level of verbal functioning should be assessed and described. Examples of the specificdescriptions for “with accompanying language impairment” might include no intelligiblespeech (nonverbal), single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals“without accompanying language impairment” might be further described by speaks infull sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language may lag behind expressivelanguage development in autism spectrum disorder, receptive and expressive languageskills should be considered separately.The specifier “associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental fac-tor” should be used when the individual has a known genetic disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome,Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome), a medical disorder (e.g. epilepsy), or a history of envi-ronmental exposure (e.g., valproate, fetal alcohol syndrome, very low birth weight).Additional neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral conditions should also be noted(e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; developmental coordination disorder; dis-ruptive behavior, impulse-control, or conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolardisorders; tics or Tourette’s disorder; self-injury; feeding, elimination, or sleep disorders).Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent impairment in reciprocalsocial communication and social interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive pat-terns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present fromearly childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning (Criteria C and D). The stage atwhich functional impairment becomes obvious will vary according to characteristics ofthe individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in thedevelopmental period, but intervention, compensation, and current supports may maskdifficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder also vary greatly de-pending on the severity of the autistic condition, developmental level, and chronological age;hence, the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders previously re-ferred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner’s autism, high-functioningautism, atypical autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, child-hood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger’s disorder.The impairments in communication and social interaction specified in Criterion A arepervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiplesources of information, including clinician’s observations, caregiver history, and, whenpossible, self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have varyingmanifestations, depending on the individual’s age, intellectual level, and language ability,as well as other factors such as treatment history and current support. Many individualshave language deficits, ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays,poor comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal language. Evenwhen formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar) are intact, the use of language forreciprocal social communication is impaired in autism spectrum disorder.Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage with others and sharethoughts and feelings) are clearly evident in young children with the disorder, who mayshow little or no initiation of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with re-duced or absent imitation of others’ behavior. What language exists is often one-sided,lacking in social reciprocity, and used to request or label rather than to comment, sharefeelings, or converse. In adults without intellectual disabilities or language delays, deficitsin social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties processing and re-sponding to complex social cues (e.g., when and how to join a conversation, what not tosay). Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social challenges stillstruggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer from the effort and anxiety of con-sciously calculating what is socially intuitive for most individuals.54Neurodevelopmental DisordersDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction are mani-fested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of eye contact (relative to cultural norms), ges-tures, facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation. An early feature of autismspectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by a lack of pointing, showing,or bringing objects to share interest with others, or failure to follow someone’s pointing oreye gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional gestures, but their repertoire is smallerthan that of others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in com-munication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbalcommunication with speech may give the impression of odd, wooden, or exaggerated“body language” during interactions. Impairment may be relatively subtle within indi-vidual modes (e.g., someone may have relatively good eye contact when speaking) butnoticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture, prosody, and facial ex-pression for social communication.Def ic its in deve lop ing , ma inta in ing , and understand ing re lat ionsh ips shou ld bejudged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent, reduced, or atyp-ical social interest , manifested by re jection of others , pass iv ity , or inappropriate ap-proaches that seem aggressive or disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident inyoung children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and imagination (e.g.,age-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, later, insistence on playing by very fixed rules.Older individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate inone situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior during a job interview), or the differentways that language may be used to communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be anapparent preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger or olderpeople. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships without a complete or realisticidea of what friendship entails (e.g., one-sided friendships or friendships based solely onshared special interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are alsoimportant to consider (in terms of reciprocity).Autism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,interests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a range of manifestationsaccording to age and ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitivebehaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger flicking), repeti-tive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echola-lia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard words; use of “you” when referring toself; stereotyped use of words, phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive adherence to rou-tines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change (e.g., dis-tress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence onadherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal be-havior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interestsin autism spectrum disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus (e .g ., a toddlerstrongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an adult spendinghours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hy-per- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, manifested through extreme responses to specificsounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights orspinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold. Extreme re-action to or rituals involving taste, smell, texture, or appearance of food or excessive foodrestrictions are common and may be a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder.Many adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language disabili-ties learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special interests may be a source ofpleasure and motivation and provide avenues for education and employment later in life.Diagnostic criteria may be met when restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests,or activities were clearly present during childhood or at some time in the past, even ifsymptoms are no longer present.Autism Spectrum Disorder55Criterion D requires that the features must cause clinically significant impairment in so-cial, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Criterion E specifies thatthe social communication deficits, although sometimes accompanied by intellectual disabil-ity (intellectual developmental disorder), are not in line with the individual’s developmentallevel; impairments exceed difficulties expected on the basis of developmental level.Standardized behavioral diagnostic instruments with good psychometric properties,including caregiver interviews, questionnaires and clinician observation measures, areavailable and can improve reliability of diagnosis over time and across clinicians.Associated Features Supporting DiagnosisMany individuals with autism spectrum disorder also have intellectual impairment and/orlanguage impairment (e.g., slow to talk, language comprehension behind production). Eventhose with average or high intelligence have an uneven profile of abilities. The gap betweenintellectual and adaptive functional skills is often large. Motor deficits are often present, in-cluding odd gait, clumsiness, and other abnormal motor signs (e.g., walking on tiptoes). Self-injury (e.g., head banging, biting the wrist) may occur, and disruptive/challenging behav-iors are more common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder thanother disorders, including intellectual disability. Adolescents and adults with autism spec-trum disorder are prone to anxiety and depression. Some individuals develop catatonic-likemotor behavior (slowing and “freezing” mid-action), but these are typically not of the mag-nitude of a catatonic episode. However, it is possible for individuals with autism spectrumdisorder to experience a marked deterioration in motor symptoms and display a full cata-tonic episode with symptoms such as mutism, posturing, grimacing and waxy flexibility.The risk period for comorbid catatonia appears to be greatest in the adolescent years.Prevalence 
In recent years, reported frequencies for autism spectrum disorder across U.S. and non-U.S. countries have approached 1% of the population, with similar estimates in child andadult samples. It remains unclear whether higher rates reflect an expansion of the diag-nostic criteria of DSM-IV to include subthreshold cases, increased awareness, differencesin study methodology, or a true increase in the frequency of autism spectrum disorder.Development and CourseThe age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum disorder. Symptomsare typically recognized during the second year of life (12–24 months of age) but may be seenearlier than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months ifsymptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include informationabout early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases whereskills have been lost, parents or caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relativelyrapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this would occur be-tween 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmen-tal regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously describedas childhood disintegrative disorder).The behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident in earlychildhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the firstyear of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental pla-teaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors oruse of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disor-ders and may be a useful “red flag” for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusualand warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses of skills beyond socialcommunication (e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the
