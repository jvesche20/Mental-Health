Zoom meeting at 8:00 PM with Josh.
	• Word comparisons
	• Length of matches compared to total matches for illness
		○ 10 symptoms for illness and 5 matches = 50% match
	• Questions are stored in the database; symptoms inserted at underscores
		○ String replacements done in the GUI
	• DataHandler has all of the database functions
	• How many disorders could we diagnose?
		○ Josh skipped the drugs & addiction chapter of the DSM
		○ Catatonic issue was not diagnosed
	• Symptoms were reviewed and assigned to questions by hand
		○ words.txt
	• Ask questions until we get a top five, then don't go any further; past that point, there is probably no illness
There may be issues with passing data back and forth between Java and Python
