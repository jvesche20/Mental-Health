Meeting at 8:00 PM EST

Meeting notes:
	• Sonali: Did we have to add missing files, but did run
	• Salvatore screen sharing
		○ Select user type: doctor vs. patient
		○ (Dr. Azar: two people not attending today's meeting: Peter and [new member] Austin. Record the meeting for them)
		○ Doctor portal:
			§ Table with patient IDs; able to add new patients
				□ Name
				□ Gender
				□ Problem description
			§ Questions should get patient score for illness closer to 50% goal
				□ Just inserts a keyword into the sentence
				□ Not sure how ties are handled
				□ Questions associated to illness(es) that are possible
				□ Behaves like an expert system
				□ Manually writing in questions would be tedious, hence why Josh tried to make it more generic
					® Scrapped thesaurus module
			§ Keywords for patients on review; also pre-existing conditions and drug/alcohol use
				□ Latter their own attributes
	• Make sure we're using the Access database from the Google Drive folder, since it's the newest and the only one on there
		○ Questions table
	• Maybe create a flowchart?
	• Consider GitLab for source control
	• Dr. Azar:
		○ Focus on working program
		○ Dynamically updating questions for illnesses
		○ Take previous cases into account
		○ On-campus meeting with everybody for two hours to go over the code in person
		○ Establish a base line
	• Set up the code in our preferred IDEs and get it to work
	• See about getting the code into a private GitLab repository and share it
	• Meeting this Sunday for code review
