"1","(Intellectual Developmental Disorder)","The essential fèatures of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) are deficits in general mental abilities (Criterion A) and impairment in everyday adaptive functioning, in comparison to an individual's age-, gender-, and socioculturally matched peers (Criterion B). Onset is during the developmental period (Criterion C). The diagnosis of intellectual disability is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of intellectual and adaptive functions.Criterion A refers to intellectual functions that involve reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, learning from instruction and experience, and practical understanding. Critical components include verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, and cognitive ef­ficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically measured with individually administered and psychometrically valid, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound tests of intelligence. Individuals with intellectual disability have scores of approximately two standard deviations or more below the population mean, including a margin for mea­surement error (generally +5 points). On tests with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100, this involves a score of 65-75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are required to interpret test results and assess intellectual performance.Factors that may affect test scores include practice effects and the ""Flynn effect' (i.e., overly high scores due to out-of-date test norms). Invalid scores may result from the use of brief intelligence screening tests or group tests; highly discrepant individual subtest scores may make an overall IQ score invalid. Instruments must be normed for the individual's so­ciocultural background and native language. Co-occurring disorders that affect communi­cation, language, and/or motor or sensory function may affect test scores. Individual cognitive profiles based on neuropsychological testing are more useful for understanding intellectual abilities than a single IQ score. Such testing may identify areas of relative strengths and weaknesses, an assessment important for academic and vocational planning.IQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks. For example, a per­son with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe adaptive behavior problems in social judgment, social understanding, and other areas of adaptive functioning that the person's actual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score. Thus, clinical judgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.Deficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a person meets community standards of personal independence and social responsibility, in comparison to others of sim­ilar age and sociocultural background. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic) domain involves competence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practical knowledge, problem solving, and judgment in novel situations, among others. The social do­main involves awareness of others' thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy; interper­sonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social judgment, among others. The practical domain involves learning and self-management across life settings, including personal care, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of behavior, and school and work task organization, among others. Intellectual capacity, education, motivation, socialization, personality features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexisting general medical conditions or mental disorders influence adaptive functioning.Adaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound measures. Standardized measures are used with knowledgeable informants (e.g., parent or other family member; teacher; coun­selor; care provider) and the individual to the extent possible. Additional sources of infor­mation include educational, developmental, medical, and mental health evaluations. Scores from standardized measures and interview sources must be interpreted using clin­ical judgment. When standardized testing is difficult or impossible, because of a variety offactors (e.g., sensory impairment, severe problem behavior), the individual may be diag­nosed with unspecified intellectual disability. Adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative in­formation reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.Criterion B is met when at least one domain of adaptive functioning—conceptual, so­cial, or practical—is sufficiently impaired that ongoing support is needed in order for the person to perform adequately in one or more life settings at school, at work, at home, or in the community. To meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability, the deficits in adap­tive functioning must be directly related to the intellectual impairments described in Cri­terion A. Criterion C, onset during the developmental period, refers to recognition that intellectual and adaptive deficits are present during childhood or adolescence.",
"2","Language Disorder","The core diagnostic features of language disorder are difficulties in the acquisition and use of language due to deficits in the comprehension or production of vocabulary, sentence structure, and discourse. The language deficits are evident in spoken communication, written communication, or sign language. Language learning and use is dependent on both receptive and expressive skills. Expressive ability refers to the production of vocal, ges­tural, or verbal signals, while receptive ability refers to the process of receiving and com­prehending language messages. Language skills need to be assessed in both expressive and receptive modalities as these may differ in severity. For example, an individual's ex­pressive language may be severely impaired, while his receptive language is hardly im­paired at all.Language disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these effects then limit the capacity for discourse. The child's first words and phrases are likely to be delayed in onset; vocabulary size is smaller and less varied than expected; and sentences are shorter and less complex with grammatical errors, especially in past tense. Deficits in com­prehension of language are frequently underestimated, as children may be good at using context to infer meaning. There may be word-finding problems, impoverished verbal def­initions, or poor understanding of synonyms, multiple meanings, or word play appro­priate for age and culture. Problems with remembering new words and sentences are manifested by difficulties following instructions of increasing length, difficulties rehears­ing strings of verbal information (e.g., remembering a phone number or a shopping list), and difficulties remembering novel sound sequences, a skill that may be important for learning new words. Difficulties with discourse are shown by a reduced ability to provide adequate information about the key events and to narrate a coherent story.The language difficulty is manifest by abilities substantially and quantifiably below that expected for age and significantly interfering with academic achievement, occupa­tional performance, effective communication, or socialization (Criterion B). A diagnosis of language disorder is made based on the synthesis of the individual's history, direct clinical observation in different contexts (i.e., home, school, or work), and scores from standard­ized tests of language ability that can be used to guide estimates of severity.",
"3","Speech Sound Disorder","Speech sound production describes the clear articulation of the phonemes (i.e., individual sounds) that in combination make up spoken words. Speech sound production requires both the phonological knowledge of speech sounds and the ability to coordinate the movements of the articulators (i.e., the jaw, tongue, and lips,) with breathing and vocalizing for speech. Chil­dren with speech production difficulties may experience difficulty with phonological knowl­edge of speech sounds or the ability to coordinate movements for speech in varying degrees. Speech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous in its underlying mechanisms and includes pho­nological disorder and articulation disorder. A speech sound disorder is diagnosed when speech sound production is not what would be expected based on the child's age and devel­opmental stage and when the deficits are not the result of a physical, structural, neurological, or hearing impairment. Among typically developing children at age 4 years, overall speech should be intelligible, whereas at age 2 years, only 50% may be understandable.",
"4","Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)","The essential feature of childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) is a disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that is inappropriate for the individual's age. This disturbance is characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds or syllables and by other types of speech dysfluencies, including broken words (e.g., pauses within a word), audible or silent blocl^g (i.e., filled or unfilled pauses in speech), circumlocutions (i.e., word substitutions to avoid problematic words), words produced with an excess of physical tension, and monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., 'T-I-I-I see him""). The disturbance in fluency interferes with academic or occupational achieve­ment or with social communication. The extent of the disturbance varies from situation to situation and often is more severe when there is special pressure to communicate (e.g., giv­ing a report at school, interviewing for a job). Dysfluency is often absent during oral read­ing, singing, or talking to inanimate objects or to pets.",
"5","Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder","Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is characterized by a primary difficulty with pragmatics, or the social use of language and communication, as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in nat­uralistic contexts, changing language according to the needs of the listener or situation, and following rules for conversations and storytelling. The deficits in social communica­tion result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, devel­opment of social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance. The deficits are not better explained by low abilities in the domains of structural language or cognitive abihty.",
"6","Unspecified Communication Disorder","The essential features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent impairment in reciprocal social communication and social interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive pat­terns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present from early childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning (Criteria C and D). The stage at which functional impairment becomes obvious will vary according to characteristics of the individual and his or her environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in the developmental period, but intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder also vary greatly de­pending on the severity of the autistic condition, developmental level, and chronological age; hence, the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders previously re­ferred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner's autism, high-functioning autism, atypical autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, child­hood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger's disorder.The impairments in communication and social interaction specified in Criterion A are pervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple sources of information, including clinician's observations, caregiver history, and, when possible, self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have varying manifestations, depending on the individual's age, intellectual level, and language ability, as well as other factors such as treatment history and current support. Many individuals have language deficits, ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays, poor comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal language. Even when formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar) are intact, the use of language for reciprocal social communication is impaired in autism spectrum disorder.Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage with others and share thoughts and feelings) are clearly evident in young children with the disorder, who may show little or no initiation of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with re­duced or absent imitation of others' behavior. What language exists is often one-sided, lacking in social reciprocity, and used to request or label rather than to comment, share feelings, or converse. In adults without intellectual disabilities or language delays, deficits in social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties processing and re­sponding to complex social cues (e.g., when and how to join a conversation, what not to say). Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social challenges still struggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer from the effort and anxiety of con­sciously calculating what is socially intuitive for most individuals.Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction are mani­fested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of eye contact (relative to cultural norms), ges­tures, facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation. An early feature of autism spectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by a lack of pointing, showing, or bringing objects to share interest with others, or failure to follow someone's pointing or eye gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional gestures, but their repertoire is smaller than that of others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in com­munication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbal communication with speech may give the impression of odd, wooden, or exaggerated ""body language"" during interactions. Impairment may be relatively subtle within indi­vidual modes (e.g., someone may have relatively good eye contact when speaking) but noticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture, prosody, and facial ex­pression for social communication.Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships should be judged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent, reduced, or atyp­ical social interest, manifested by rejection of others, passivity, or inappropriate ap­proaches that seem aggressive or disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident in young children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and imagination (e.g., age-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, later, insistence on playing by very fixed rules. Older individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate in one situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior during a job interview), or the different ways that language may be used to communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an apparent preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger or older people. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships without a complete or realistic idea of what friendship entails (e.g., one-sided friendships or friendships based solely on shared special interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are also important to consider (in terms of reciprocity).Autism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a range of manifestations according to age and ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive behaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger flicking), repeti­tive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echola- lia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard words; use of ""you"" when referring to self; stereotyped use of words, phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive adherence to rou­tines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change (e.g., dis­tress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence on adherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal be­havior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests in autism spectrum disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a toddler strongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an adult spending hours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hy­per- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, manifested through extreme responses to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or spinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain, heat, or cold. Extreme re­action to or rituals involving taste, smell, texture, or appearance of food or excessive food restrictions are common and may be a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder.Many adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language disabili­ties learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special interests may be a source of pleasure and motivation and provide avenues for education and employment later in life. Diagnostic criteria may be met when restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities were clearly present during childhood or at some time in the past, even if symptoms are no longer present.Criterion D requires that the features must cause clinically significant impairment in so­cial, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Criterion E specifies that the social communication deficits, although sometimes accompanied by intellectual disabil­ity (intellectual developmental disorder), are not in line with the individual's developmental level; impairments exceed difficulties expected on the basis of developmental level.Standardized behavioral diagnostic instruments with good psychometric properties, including caregiver interviews, questionnaires and clinician observation measures, are available and can improve reliability of diagnosis over time and across clinicians.",
"7","Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder","The essential feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking persistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to defiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as a child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk­ativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others out with their activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment without forethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the street without looking). Impulsivity may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an in­ability to delay gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness (e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important decisions without con­sideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without adequate information).ADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms be present before age 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child­hood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es­tablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms tends to be unreliable, and it is beneficial to obtain ancillary information.Manifestations of the disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and school, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be done accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set­tings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the disorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for appropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe­cially interesting activities, has consistent external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens), or is interacting in one-on-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office).",
"8","Hyperactivity Disorder","Specific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a biological origin that is the basis for abnormalities at a cognitive level that are associated with the behavioral signs of the disorder. The biological origin includes an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and en­vironmental factors, which affect the brain's ability to perceive or process verbal or non­verbal information efficiently and accurately.One essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent difficulties learning key­stone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the de­velopmental period). Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and fluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and mathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast to talking or walking, which are acquired developmental milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic skills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly. Specific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not sim­ply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties mastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g., history, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the underlying academic skills. Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one's lan­guage— t̂o read printed words (often called dyslexia)—is one of the most common manifesta­tions of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable, descriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1-A6). These clinical symptoms may be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat­ing scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning difficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as restricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class­mates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example, difficulties learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of instruction in phonological skills or word identification strategies may indicate a specificlearning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from cumulative school reports, portfolios of the child's evaluated work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical interview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy skills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by cumulative evidence from school reports, evaluated portfolios of work, or previous assessments.A second key feature is that the individual's performance of the affected academic skills is well below average for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning academic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustain­able only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support. In children, the low academic skills cause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and teacher's grades or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of activities that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic skills interfere with occupational performance or everyday activities requiring those skills (as indicated by self-re­port or report by others). However, this criterion also requires psychometric evidence from an individually administered, psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of aca­demic achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. Academic skills are dis­tributed along a continuum, so there is no natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate individuals with and without specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify what constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic skills weU below age expectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low achievement scores on one or more standard­ized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] be­low the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is below the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest diagnostic certainty. However, precise scores will vary according to the particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of clinical judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0-2.5 SD below the pop­ulation mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported by converging evidence from clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since standardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in part on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures.A third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the early school years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in others, the learning difficulties may not manifest fully until later school years, by which time learning demands have in­creased and exceed the individual's limited capacities.Another key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are considered ""spe­cific,"" for four reasons. First, they are not attributable to intellectual disabilities (intellec­tual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]); global developmental delay; hearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders) (Criterion D). Specific learning disorder affects learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal lev­els of intellectual functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater than about 70 [±5 points allowing for measurement error]). The phrase ""unexpected academic under­achievement"" is often cited as the defining characteristic of specific learning disorder in that the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as manifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning dis­order may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually ""gifted."" These individuals may be able to sustain apparentiy adequate academic functioning by using compensatory strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assess­ment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating their learning or accomplishing required tasks. Second, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to more general external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absen­teeism, or lack of education as typically provided in the individual's community context. Third, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to a neurological (e.g., pediatric stroke) or motor disorders or to vision or hearing disorders, which are often associated with prob­lems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.Finally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read­ing single words, retrieving or calculating number facts).Comprehensive assessment is required. Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed after formal education starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles­cents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific learn­ing disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of the individual's medical, developmental, educational, and family history; the history of the learning difficulty, including its previous and current manifestation; the impact of the diffi­culty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports; portfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or current scores from individual standardized tests of academic achievement. If an intellectual, sensory, neurological, or motor disorder is suspected, then the clinical assessment for specific learning disorder should also include methods appropriate for these disorders. Thus, compre­hensive assessment will involve professionals with expertise in specific learning disorder and psychological/cognitive assessment. Since specific learning disorder typically persists into adulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary, unless indicated by marked changes in the learn­ing difficulties (amelioration or worsening) or requested for specific purposes.",
"9","Hyperactivity Disorder","",
"10","Stereotypic Movement Disorder","The essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A). These behaviors are often rhythmical movements of the head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive function. The movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop them. Among typically devel­oping children, the repetitive movements may be stopped when attention is directed to them or when the child is distracted from performing them. Among children with neuro­developmental disorders, the behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts. In other cases, the individual demonstrates self-restraining behaviors (e.g., sitting on hands, wrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective device).The repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual presents with his or her own in­dividually patterned, ""signature"" behavior. Examples of non-self-injurious stereotypic movements include, but are not limited to, body rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating hand movements, flicking or fluttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or flapping, and head nodding. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors include, but are not limited to, re­petitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of hands, lips, or other body parts. Eye poking is particularly concerning; it occurs more frequently among children with visual impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g., cocking the head, rocking the torso, waving a small string repetitively in front of the face).Stereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting a few seconds to several minutes or longer. Frequency can vary from many occurrences in a single day to several weeks elapsing between episodes. The behaviors vary in context, occurring when the individual is engrossed in other activities, when excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored. Criterion A requires that the movements be ""apparently"" purposeless. However, some functions may be served by the movements. For example, stereotypic movements might reduce anxiety in response to external stressors.Criterion B states that the stereotypic movements interfere with social, academic, or other activities and, in some children, may result in self-injury (or would if protective mea­sures were not used). If self-injury is present, it should be coded using the specifier. Onsetof stereotypic movements is in the early developmental period (Criterion C). Criterion D states that the repetitive, stereotyped behavior in stereotypic movement disorder is not at­tributable to the^physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and is not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder. The presence of stereotypic movements may indicate an undetected neurodevelopmental problem, espe­cially in children ages 1-3 years.",
"11","Tic Disorders","Tic disorders comprise four diagnostic categories: Tourette's disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder, and the other specified and unspecified tic disorders. Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of motor and/or vocal tics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms (Criterion B), age at onset (Criterion C), and ab­sence of any known cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D). The tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette's disorder, followed by persistent [chronic] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed by provisional tic disorder, followed by theother specified and unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic disorder at one level of the hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E).Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. An individual may have various tic symptoms over time, but at any point in time, the tic rep­ertoire recurs in a characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group or vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or throat clearing, are common across patient populations. Tics are generally experienced as involuntary but can be vol­untarily suppressed for varying lengths of time.Tics can be either simple or complex. Simple motor tics are of short duration (i.e., milli­seconds) and can include eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and extension of the extrem­ities. Simple vocal tics include throat clearing, sniffing, and grunting often caused by contraction of the diaphragm or muscles of the oropharynx. Complex motor tics are of lon­ger duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of simple tics such as simul­taneous head turning and shoulder shrugging. Complex tics can appear purposeful, such as a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture (copropraxia) or a tic-like imitation of someone else's movements (echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one's own sounds or words {palilalia), repeating the last-heard word or phrase (echolalia), or uttering socially unacceptable words, including obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs (coprolalia). Importantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and lacks the prosody of similar inappropriate speech observed in human interactions.The presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic disorders (Criterion A). For Tourette's disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas for per­sistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For provisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For other specified or un­specified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms are best characterized as tics but are atypical in presentation or age at onset, or have a known etiology.The 1-year minimum duration criterion (Criterion B) assures that individuals diag­nosed with either Tourette's disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder have had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wane in severity, and some individuals may have tic-free periods of weeks to months; however, an individual who has had tic symp­toms of greater than 1 year's duration since first tic onset would be considered to have per­sistent symptoms regardless of duration of tic-free periods. For an individual with motor and/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since first tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis can be considered. There is no duration specification for other specified and unspecified tic disorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years (Criterion C). Tic disorders typically begin in the prepubertal period, with an average age at onset between 4 and 6 years, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New onset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly rare and is often associated with expo­sures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult (e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is not uncommon for adolescents and adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment and, when carefully evaluated, provide a history of milder symptoms dating back to child­hood. New-onset abnormal movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range should result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific etiologies.Tic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or an­other medical condition (Criterion D). When there is strong evidence from the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and probable cause for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should be used.Having previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette's disorder negates a possible di­agnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder (Criterion E). Similarly, a previ­ous diagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder negates a diagnosis of provisional tic disorder or other specified or unspecified tic disorder (Criterion E).",
"12","Other Specified Tic Disorder","The essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more delusions that persist for at least 1 month (Criterion A). A diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if the individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for schizophre­nia (Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact of the delusions, impairments in psychoso­cial functioning may be more circumscribed than those seen in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion C). If mood episodes occur concurrently with the delusions, the total duration of these mood episodes is brief relative to the total duration of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and are not better explained by another men­tal disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (Crite­rion E).In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit­ically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy­chotic disorders.",
"13","Unspecified Tic Disorder","",
"14","Schizophreniform Disorder","The characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizo­phrenia (Criterion A). Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished by its difference in du­ration: the total duration of the illness, including prodromal, active, and residual phases, is at least 1 month but less than 6 months (Criterion B). The duration requirement for schizo­phreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months. The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions. 1) when an ep­isode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months and the individual has already recovered, and 2) when an individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months' duration required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the diagnosis should be noted as ""schizophreniform disorder (provisional)"" because it is uncertain if the indi­vidual will recover from the disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance per­sists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia.Another distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of a criterion requiring impaired social and occupational functioning. While such impairments may po­tentially be present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit­ically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy­chotic disorders.",
"15","Schizophrenia","The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions, but no single symptom is pathognomonic of the disorder. The di­agnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with impaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will vary sub­stantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome.At least two Criterion A symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear pres­ence of delusions (Criterion Al), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech (Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative symptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in which the active- phase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment. Criterion A is still met if the clinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment.Schizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Crite­rion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of func­tion is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The dysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not appear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to pursue goal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under Criterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment (see the section ""Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis"" for this disorder) and func­tional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia.Some signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months (Criterion C). Pi;odromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symp­toms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or delusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of de­lusional proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may have unusual perceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an unseen person); their speech may be generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly disorganized (e.g., mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the pro­dromal and residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially active may become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are often the first sign of a disorder.Mood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be con­current with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood dis­order, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for only a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit­ically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy­chotic disorders.",
"16","Schizoaffective Disorder","The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of an uninterrupted period of illness during which the individual continues to display active or residual symp­toms of psychotic illness. The diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the period of psychotic illness. At some time during the period. Criterion A for schizophreniahas to be met. Criteria B (social dysfunction) and F (exclusion of autism spectrum disorder or other commimication disorder of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be met. In addition to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode (major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because loss of in­terest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet Criterion A for schizoaffective dis­order, the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the presence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of de­pression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness (i.e., after Criterion A has been met) (Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaf­fective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions or hallucinations must be present for at least 2 ŵ eeks in the absence of a major mood epi­sode (depressive or manic) at some point during the lifetime duration of the illness (Cri­terion B for schizoaffective disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects of a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schizoaffective disorder).Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood symptoms meeting criteria for a major mood episode must be present for the majority of the total duration of the ac­tive and residual portion of the illness. Criterion C requires the assessment of mood symp­toms for the entire course of a psychotic illness, which differs from the criterion in DSM-IV, which required only an assessment of the current period of illness. If the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively brief period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaf­fective disorder. When deciding whether an individual's presentation meets Criterion C, the clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and re­sidual symptoms) and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need of treatment with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the psychotic symptoms. This determination requires sufficient historical information and clinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual symptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together, do not occupy more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presen­tation would not meet Criterion C.In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit­ically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy­chotic disorders.",
"17","Psychotic Disorder","The essential features of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder are prominent delusions and/or hallucinations (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the physiolog­ical effects of a substance/medication (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin expo­sure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that the individual realizes are substance/medication- induced are not included here and instead would be diagnosed as substance intoxicationor substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier ""with perceptual disturbances"" (applies to alcohpl withdrawal; cannabis intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and stimulant intoxication).A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxica­tion or withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas primary psychotic disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use or may occur during times of sustained ab­stinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symptoms may continue as long as the substance/ medication use continues. Another consideration is the presence of features that are atyp­ical of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course). For example, the appearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known history of a primary psychotic disorder should suggest the possibility of a substance/medication- induced psychotic disorder. Even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not rule out the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. In contrast, factors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder include persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of time (i.e., a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance with­drawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history of prior recurrent primary psy­chotic disorders. Other causes of psychotic symptoms must be considered even in an individual with substance intoxication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are not uncommon among individuals with non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders.In addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit­ically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy­chotic disorders.",
"18","Due to Another Medical Condition","The essential features of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition are promi­nent delusions or hallucinations that are judged to be attributable to the physiological ef­fects of another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical con­dition, in which case a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder, with marked stressor, would be appropriate).Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality (i.e., visual, olfactory, gustatory, tac­tile, or auditory), but certain etiological factors are likely to evoke specific hallucinatory phenomena. Olfactory hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hallucina­tions may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized, depending on etiological and environmental factors. Psychotic disorder due to another medical con­dition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallu­cinations and appreciates that they result from the medical condition. Delusions may have a variety of themes, including somatic, grandiose, religious, and, most commonly, perse­cutory. On the whole, however, associations between delusions and particular medical conditions appear to be less specific than is the case for hallucinations.In determining whether the psychotic disturbance is attributable to another medical condition, the presence of a medical condition must be identified and considered to be the etiology of the psychosis through a physiological mechanism. Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the psychotic distur­bance and the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance. One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerba­tion, or remission of the medical condition and that of the psychotic disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical for a psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations). The disturbance must also be distinguished from a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or an­other mental disorder (e.g., an adjustment disorder).",
"19","Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)","Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier) may be used when criteria are met for catatonia during the course of a neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipo­lar, depressive, or other mental disorder. The catatonia specifier is appropriate when the clinical picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance and involves at least three of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A. Catatonia is typically diagnosed in an inpatient setting and occurs in up to 35% of individuals with schizophrenia, but the ma­jority of catatonia cases involve individuals with depressive or bipolar disorders. Before the catatonia specifier is used in neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorders, a wide variety of other medical conditions need to be ruled out; these conditions include, but are not limited to, medical conditions due to infectious, met­abolic, or neurological conditions (see '""Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Con­dition""). Catatonia can also be a side effect of a medication (see the chapter ""Medication- Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication""). Because of the seriousness of the complications, particular attention should be paid to the possibility that the catatonia is attributable to 333.92 (G21.0) neuroleptic malignant syndrome.Catatonic Disorder Due to Another IVIedical ConditionDiagnostic Criteria 293.89 (F06.1)A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms:1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment).2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity).3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner).4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [Note: not applicable if there is an established aphasia]).5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli).6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity).7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements).9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.10. Grimacing.11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another’s speech).12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another’s movements).B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., a manic episode).D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa­tional, or other important areas of functioning.Coding note: Include the name of the medical condition in the name of the mental disor­der (e.g., 293.89 [F06.1]) catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the cata­tonic disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 572.2 [K71.90] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.89 [F06.1] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy).Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is the presence of catatonia that is judged to be attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition. Catatonia can be diagnosed by the presence of at least three of the 12 clinical fea­tures in Criterion A. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the catatonia is attributable to another medical condition (Crite­rion B). The diagnosis is not given if the catatonia is better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic episode) (Criterion C) or if it occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D).",
"20","Bipolar I Disorder","The essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an ab­normally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or ex­pansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present.Mood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or ""feeling on top of the world."" In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality that it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited and hap­hazard enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example, the individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public. Often the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated, particularly when the indi­vidual's wishes are denied or if the individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in mood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the alterna-tion among euphoria, dysphoria, and irritability). In children, happiness, silliness and ""goofiness"" are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmen­tal level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i.e., distinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that meet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change must be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious to those who know the child well.During the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new projects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems out of the individual's reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of the day.Inflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked grandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion Bl). Despite lack of any partic­ular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel or seeing publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a special relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child at­tempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the child's normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied.One of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is distinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but is unable. The individual may sleep httle, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than usual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individ­ual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep her­alds the onset of a manic episode.Speech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individ­uals may talk continuously and without regard for others' wishes to communicate, often in an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is sometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with dramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of speech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the individual's mood is more irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or angry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion A and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite (i.e., de­pressive) pole (see ""with mixed features"" specifier, pp. 149-150).Often the individual's thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through speech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is se­vere, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the individ­ual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak.Distractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external stimuli (e.g., the interviewer's attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in the room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational con­versation or attending to instructions.The increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and partici­pation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activi­ties. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic episode usually show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old acquaintances or calling or contacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and demanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or rest­lessness (i.e., purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta­neously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on many different topics to friends, public figures, or the media.The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit mate­rial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child's baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa­tion with other symptoms of mania.The expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead to reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions, reckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for the individual, even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences (Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to pay for them and̂  in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity or indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually transmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences.The manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational func­tioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial losses, il­legal activities, loss of employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of psychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C.Manic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects of medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or an­other medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However, a fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e.g., with medications, elec- troconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological ef­fect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a medication is fully out of the individual's system or the effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely) is sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation follow­ing antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanie episode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to meet criteria for a manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not re­quired to have hypomanie or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede or follow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanie epi­sode may be found within the text for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major de­pressive episode are described within the text for major depressive disorder.",
"21","Bipolar II Disorder","Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring mood episodes con­sisting of one or more major depressive episodes (Criteria A-C under ""Major Depressive Episode"") and at least one hypomanie episode (Criteria A-F under ""Hypomanie Epi­sode""). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomarüc epi­sode must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s), the requisite number of symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a manic episode during the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder (Criterion B under ""Bipolar II Disorder""). Episodes of substance/medication-induced de­pressive disorder or substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (repre­senting the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for depression, drugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and related disorder due to another medical condition or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition do not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiolog­ical effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In addition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Cri­terion C under ""Bipolar II Disorder""). The depressive episodes or hypomanie fluctuations must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion D under ""Bipolar II Disorder""); however, for hy­pomanie episodes, this requirement does not have to be met. A hypomanie episode that causes significant impairment would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and, therefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major depressive ep­isodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar I disorder.Individuals with bipolar II disorder typically present to a clinician during a major de­pressive episode and are unlikely to complain initially of hypomania. Typically, the hy­pomanie episodes themselves do not cause impairment. Instead, the impairment results from the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood changes and fluctuating, unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning. Individu­als with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanie episodes as pathological or dis­advantageous, although others may be troubled by the individual's erratic behavior. Clinical information from other informants, such as close friends or relatives, is often use­ful in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.A hypomanie episode should not be confused with the several days of euthymia and re­stored energy or activity that may follow remission of a major depressive episode. Despite the substantial differences in duration and severity between a manic and hypomanie episode, bi­polar II disorder is not a ""milder form"" of bipolar I disorder. Compared with individuals with bipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II disorder have greater chronicity of illness and spend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/ or disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanie episode or hypomanie symptoms co-occurring with a depressive episode are common in individuals with bipolar Π disorder and are overrepresented in females, particularly hypomania with mixed features. In­dividuals experiencing hypomania with mixed features may not label their symptoms as hy­pomania, but instead experience them as depression with increased energy or irritability.",
"22","Cyclothymic Disorder","The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanie symptoms and periods of depressive symp­toms that are distinct from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanie symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a hypo- manic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, perva­siveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (pres­ent more days than not), and any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months (Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanie episode have never been met (Criterion C).If an individual with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i.e., after the initial 2 years in adults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a major depressive, manic, or hy­pomanie episode, the diagnosis changes to major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, or other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanie episode without prior major depressive episode), respectively, and the cyclothymic disor­der diagnosis is dropped.The cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delu­sional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which ease the mood symptoms are considered asso­ciated features of the psychotic disorder. The mood disturbance must also not be attribut­able to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) (Criterion E). Although some individ­uals may function particularly well during some of the periods of hypomania, over the prolonged course of the disorder, there must be clinically significant distress or impair­ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as a result of the mood disturbance (Criterion F). The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged pe­riods of cyclical, often unpredictable mood changes (e.g., the individual may be regarded as temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable).PrevaienceThe lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is approximately 0.4%-l%. Prevalence in mood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5%. In the general population, cyclothymic disorder is apparently equally common in males and females. In clinical settings, females with cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than males.Deveiopment and CourseCyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter. Cyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a persistent course. There is a 15%-50% risk that an individual with cyclothymic disorder will subsequently develop bi­polar I disorder or bipolar II disorder. Onset of persistent, fluctuating hypomanie and de­pressive symptoms late in adult life needs to be clearly differentiated from bipolar andrelated disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) before the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is as­signed. Among children with cyclothymic disorder, the mean age at onset of symptoms is 6.5 years of age.Risk and Prognostic FactorsGenetic and physiological. Major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder are more common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with cyclo­thymic disorder than in the general population. There may also be an increased familial risk of substance-related disorders. Cyclotiiymic disorder may be more common in the first-degree biological relatives of individuals witiK bipolar I disorder than in the general population.Differentiai DiagnosisBipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical condition is made when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of a specific, usually chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination is based on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the hypomanie and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the med­ical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the med­ical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are considered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic medical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanie and de­pressive symptoms and the medical condition.Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medica­tion-induced depressive disorder. Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance/medication (especially stimu­lants) is etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these disorders that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation of substance/medication use.Bipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling.Both disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts in mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanie episode has never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder specifier ""with rapid cycling"" requires that full mood episodes be present.Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is associated with marked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the criteria are met for both disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be di­agnosed.ComorbiditySubstance-related disorders and sleep disorders (i.e., difficulties in initiating and main­taining sleep) may be present in individuals with cyclothymic disorder. Most children with cyclothymic disorder treated in outpatient psychiatric settings have comorbid mental conditions; they are more likely than other pediatric patients with mental disorders to have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related DisorderDiagnostic CriteriaA. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, with or without depressed mood, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1)and (2):1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite­rion A.C. The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not sub­stance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or related disor­der could include the following:The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms per­sist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa­tional, or other important areas of functioning.Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]- induced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10- CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance- induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder'’ before the substance-induced bipolar and related dis­order (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moder­ate [substance] use disorder'’ or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder.ICD-10-CMWith use disorder, ICD-9-CIVI mildWith use disorder, moderate or severeWithoutusedisorderAlcohol Phencyclidine Other hallucinogen291.89292.84292.84F10.14F16.14F16.14F10.24 FI 6.24 FI 6.24FI 0.94 F16.94 F16.94ICD-10-CMICD-9-CMWith use disorder, mildWith use disorder, moderate or severeWithoutusedisorderSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic 292.84 F13.14 F13.24 F13.94Amphetamine (or other stimulant)292.84 F15.14 F15.24 FI 5.94Cocaine 292.84 F14.14 F14.24 F14.94Other (or unknown) substance 292.84 F19.14 F19.24 FI 9.94Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di­agnoses associated with substance class):With onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the sub­stance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.With onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.Recording ProceduresICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disor­der begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in­cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for ""other substance"" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category ""unknown substance"" should be used.The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in­toxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxi­cation; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during in­toxication).ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disor­der begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table in­cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a co- morbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for ""other substance"" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is un­known, the category ""unknown substance"" should be used.When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word ""with,"" followed by the name of the substance-inducedbipolar and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in­toxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of irritable symptoms oc­curring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with meth- ylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication).Diagnostic FeaturesThe diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder are es­sentially the same as those for mania, hypomania, or depression. A key exception to the diag­nosis of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is the case of hypomania or mania that occurs after antidepressant medication use or other treatments and persists be­yond the physiological effects of the medication. This condition is considered an indicator of true bipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. Simi­larly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy-induced manic or hypomanie ep­isodes that persist beyond the physiological effects of the treatment are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar ^ d  related disorder.Side effects of some antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (e.g., edginess, ag­itation) may resemble the primary symptoms of a manic syndrome, but they are funda­mentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and are insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the criterion symptoms of mania/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same as excess involvement in purposeful activities), and a sufficient number of symptoms must be present (not just one or two symptoms) to make these diagnoses. In particular, the appearance of one or two nonspecific sjonptoms—irritability, edginess, or agitation during antidepressant treatment—in the absence of a full manic or hypomanie syndrome should not be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.",
"24","Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder","The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is chronic, severe persistent ir- ritabihty. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of which is frequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frus­tration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against prop­erty, self, or others). They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in the home and at school, and they must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B). The second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion D).The clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be carefully distinguished from presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric bi­polar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to address the considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of children who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present with classic (i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder.Some researchers view severe, non-episodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar dis­order in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults have distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I dis­order. During the latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that severe, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an up­surge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their pediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians com­bining at least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic, epi­sodic presentations of mania and non-episodic presentations of severe irritability have been labeled as bipolar disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly reserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagno­sis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms consisted of very severe, non- episodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, provides a distinct category for such presentations.",
"25","Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder","",
"26","Major Depressive Disorder","The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. De­pressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly ev­ery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de­nied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and demeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de­termine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psy­chomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall sever­ity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during ŵ hich there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activi­ties (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en­ergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci­sions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must have clearly worsened compared with the person's pre-episode status. The symptoms must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep­isode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu­pational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort.The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or ""down in the dumps"" (Criterion Al). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain of feeling ""blah,"" having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em­phasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif­ferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated.Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ­uals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, ""not caring anymore,"" or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for­merly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex­ual interest or desire.Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ­uals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3).Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces­sively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in- sonrmia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial in­somnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with over­sleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the dis­turbed sleep.Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand- wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness) (Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be ob­servable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may re­port sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to requiresubstantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex­hausting and take twice as long as usual.The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in­clude unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina­tions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu­sional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re­sponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or inteφersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.Many individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor decisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi­culties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In children, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individ­uals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia (''pseudodementia""). When the major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu­larly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta­tion of an irreversible dementia.Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others would be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com­mitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put their affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, an intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo­tional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to others. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide.The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symp­toms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions (e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg­nancy; insonmia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a major depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general medical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthless­ness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with particular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been mod­ified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same in­dividuals as do the full criteria.",
"27","Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)","The essential feature of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year for children and adolescents (Criterion A). This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major de­pression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may occur during persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major de­pressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder as well as major depressive disorder.Individuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or ""down in the dumps."" During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from Criterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual's day-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., ""I've always been thisway""), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. E>uring the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than2 months (Criterion C).",
"28","Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder","The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are the expression of mood la­bility, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the pre­menstrual phase of the cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter. These symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms. Symptoms must have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social functioning. The intensity and/or expressivity of the ac­companying symptoms may be closely related to social and cultural background charac­teristics of the affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as religious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues.Typically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses. Although it is not uncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few days of menses, the individual must have a symptom-free period in the follicular phase after the menstrual period begins. While the core symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic symptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of physical and/or behavioral symptoms in the absence of mood and/or anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diag­nosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but not duration) to those of another mental disorder, such â  a major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder. In order to confirm a provisional diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required for at least two symptomatic cycles.",
"29","Depressive Disorder","The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder include the symptoms of a depressive disorder, such as major depressive disorder; however, the de­pressive symptoms are associated with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a sub­stance (e.g., drug of abuse, toxin, psychotropic medication, other medication), and the depressive symptoms persist beyond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxi­cation, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical history, physical examination, or laboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder should have developed during or within 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disor­der (Criterion Bl). In addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an independent depressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder includes the de­pressive disorder preceded the onset of ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the depressive disorder persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of sub­stance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should not be made when symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The de­pressive disorder associated with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor­tant areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).Some medications (e.g., stimulants, steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics, central nervous system drugs, dermatological agents, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents)can induce depressive mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine whether the medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or whether a primary depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was receiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that developed within the first several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individ­ual with no history of major depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of med­ication-induced depressive disorder. In some cases, a previously established condition (e.g., major depressive disorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally taking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral contraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the med­ication is causative in this particular situation.A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary depressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the substance use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or labora­tory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the depressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively pro­tracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for a long period after the cessation of substance use.",
"30","Due to Another l\/ledical Condition","The essential feature of depressive disorder due to another medical condition is a promi­nent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or plea­sure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture (Criterion A) and that is thought to be related to the direct physiological effects of another medical con­dition (Criterion B). In determining whether the mood disturbance is due to a general medical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical con­dition. Further, the clinician must establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically re­lated to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Al­though there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical condition and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of fea­tures that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course or absence of family history). Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a di­rect association between the general medical condition in question and the development of mood symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation.",
"31","Separation Anxiety Disorder","The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected given the person's developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience recurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is an­ticipated or occurs (Criterion Al). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment figures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts of their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also worry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or having an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major at­tachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant or refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have persistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be un­able to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display ""clinging"" behavior, staying close to or ""shadowing"" the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with them when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluc­tance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep away from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bed­time and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night, they may make their way to their parents' bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sib­ling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends' homes, or to go on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping in a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in­dividual's separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other catastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints, nausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment fig­ures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and adults.The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However, the duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im­pairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Cri­terion C).",
"32","Selective Mutism","When encountering other individuals in social interactions, children with selective mut­ism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to by others. Lack of speech occurs in social interactions with children or adults. Children with selective mut­ism will speak in their home in the presence of immediate family members but often not even in front of close friends or second-degree relatives, such as grandparents or cousins. The disturbance is often marked by high social anxiety. Children with selective mutism of­ten refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impairment, as teachers often find it difficult to assess skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with social communication, although children with this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or nonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, writing) to communicate and may be willing or eager to perform or engage in social encounters when speech is not required (e.g., nonver­bal parts in school plays).",
"33","Specific Phobia","A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a particular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus. The cat­egories of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects or situations from more than one category, or phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific phobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the pop­ulation. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i.e., ""marked"") (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared object or situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the object or situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic at­tack (i.e., expected panic attack). Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxi­ety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the phobic stimulus (Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being con­fronted with the situation or object (e.g., becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every five airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear or anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different occasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors such as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threatening elements such as turbulence on a flight for individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed dif­ferently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic ob­ject or situation is encountered (i.e., immediately rather than being delayed).The individual actively avoids the situation, or if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation or object evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active avoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent or minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges on daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi­ders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid-ance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual who fears blood refusing to go to the doctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to look at pictures ihat resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific phobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in ways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation as much as possible (e.g., an indi­vidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of the particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their daily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities that would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to ac­cept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic.The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the object or situation poses, or more intense than is deemed necessary (Criterion D). Although individuals with specific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overesti­mate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the judgment of being out of propor­tion is made by the clinician. The individual's sociocultural context should also be taken into account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing violence, and fear of insects may be more disproportionate in settings where insects are consumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears that are common in the population, particularly among children. However, the duration criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc­cupational, or other important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diag­nosed (Criterion F).",
"34","Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)","The essential feature of social anxiety disorder is a marked, or intense, fear or anxiety of so­cial situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults (Criterion A). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be neg­atively evaluated. The individual is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious, weak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that he or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing, trembling, sweating, stumbling over one's words, or staring, that will be negatively eval­uated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as a result. Fear of offending others—for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symp­toms—may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with strong collectivistic orientations. An individual with fear of trembling of the hands may avoid drinking, eat­ing, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking hands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public per­formance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some individuals fear and avoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or ""shy bladder syndrome"").The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an in­dividual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situation(s) would not be di­agnosed with social anxiety disorder. However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety may vary (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The antici­patory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying every day for weeks before attending a social event, repeating a speech for days in advance). In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or shrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the feared social situations. Alternatively, the situations are endured with intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Avoid-ance can be extensive (e.g., not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle (e.g., overpre­paring the text of a speech, diverting attention to others, limiting eye contact).The fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being nega­tively evaluated or to the consequences of such negative evaluation (Criterion E). Some­times, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual danger (e.g., being bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social anx­iety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social situations, and thus the judgment of being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual's socio­cultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For ex­ample, in certain cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be considered appropriate in social situations (e.g., might be seen as a sign of respect).The duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months (Criterion F). This dura­tion threshold helps distinguish the disorder from transient social fears that are com­mon, particularly among children and in the community. However, the duration criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The fear, anxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the individual's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar­eas of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid to speak in pub­lic would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder if this activity is not routinely encountered on the job or in classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly dis­tressed about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is passed over for, the job or educa­tion he or she really wants because of social anxiety symptoms. Criterion G is met.",
"35","Panic Disorder","Panic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur. The term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic attack. The term unex­pected refers to a panic attack for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of oc­currence—that is, the attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the individual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected panic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in which panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are ex­pected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a com­bination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack and the individual's own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic at­tacks as expected or unexpected (see section ""Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues"" for this disorder). In the United States and Europe, approximately one-half of individuals with panic disorder have expected panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the presence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For more details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompa­nying panic attacks (pp. 214-217).The frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there may be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short bursts of more frequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any at­tacks or with less frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who have infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic attacks in terms of panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidity with other disorders, family history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder may have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than four symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently differ from one panic attack to the next. However, more than one unexpected full-symp­tom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder.The worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to physical con­cerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses (e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of being judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about mental functioning, such as ''going crazy"" or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive changes in behavior represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their conse­quences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure that help is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily activities, and avoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public transportation, or shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.",
"36","Agoraphobia","The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis re­quires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations: 1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or planes; 2) being in open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplaces, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces, such as shops, theaters, or cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being out­side of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exhaustive; other situations may be feared. When experiencing fear and anxiety cued by such situations, individuals typically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individ­uals frequently believe that escape from such situations might be difficult (e.g., ""can't get out of here"") or that help might be unavailable (e.g., ""there is nobody to help me"") when panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. ""Panic-like symptoms"" refer to any of the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic attack, such as dizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. ""Other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms"" include symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in older adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting lost.The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full- or limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an ex­pected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line on only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The in­dividual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the in­dividual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or min­imize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e.g., changingdaily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public transportation, arranging for food delivery to avoid entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using distraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so severe that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to con­front a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or health professional.The fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating clinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur­ing a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking lot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons. First, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and sociocultural contexts (e.g., it is socioculturally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts of the world to avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be con­sidered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their fears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their fears as being out of pro­portion to the actual risk. Third, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate danger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agoraphobia should be diag­nosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists (Criterion F) and if it causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func­tioning (Criterion G). The duration of ""typically lasting for 6 months or more"" is meant to exclude individuals with short-lived, transient problems. However, the duration criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.",
"37","Generalized Anxiety Disorder","The essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (ap­prehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or frequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact of the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with gener­alized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as possible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfor­tune to their children, or minor matters (e.g., doing household chores or being late for ap­pointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about their competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder, the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.Several features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety. First, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically in­terfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life are not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more pressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder aremore pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur without précipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person worries (e.g., finances, children's safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symp­toms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much less likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due to constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, al­though only one additional symptom is required in children.",
"38","Anxiety Disorder","The essential features of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects of a sub­stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symp­toms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of pro­ducing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a withdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the panic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to a month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of with­drawal). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be given if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/medication in­toxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i.e., usually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered.The substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made in­stead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.",
"39","Another Medical Condition","The essential feature of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is clinically signifi­cant anxiety that is judged to be best explained as a physiological effect of another medical con­dition. Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated physical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, in particular, adjustment disorder, with anxiety, in which the stressor is the medical condition (Criterion C). In this case, an individual with adjustment disorder is espe­cially distressed about the meaning or the consequences of the associated medical condition. By contrast, there is often a prominent physical component to the anxiety (e.g., shortness of breath) when the anxiety is due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is not made if the anxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The anxiety symp­toms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E).In determining whether the anxiety symptoms are attributable to another medical con­dition, the clinician must first establish the presence of the medical condition. Further­more, it must be established that anxiety symptoms can be etiologically related to the medical condition through a physiological mechanism before making a judgment that this is the best explanation for the symptoms in a specific individual. A careful and compre­hensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Several aspects of the clinical presentation should be considered: 1) the presence of a clear temporal asso­ciation between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the anx­iety symptoms; 2) the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known phys­iological mechanism (e.g., hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In addition, the disturbance must not be better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, a substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder, or another primary mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder).",
"40","Unspecified Anxiety Disorder","The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri­terion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images (e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neu­tralize them with another thought or action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD have both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that some­thing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels ""just right"")· The aim is to reduce the distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How­ever, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g., arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress.Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g., more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in- tmsive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e.g., double-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com­pulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms, spending 1-3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly constant intmsive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating).",
"41","Body Dysmorphic Disorder","Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (formerly known as dysmorphophobia) are pre­occupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance, which they believe look ugly, unattractive, abnormal, or deformed (Criterion A). The perceived flaws are not observable or appear only slight to other individuals. Concerns range from looking ""unattractive"" or ""not right"" to looking ""hideous"" or ""like a monster."" Preoccu­pations can focus on one or many body areas, most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived acne, scars, lines, wrinkles, paleness), hair (e.g., ""thinning"" hair or ""excessive"" body or fa­cial hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape). However, any body area can be the focus of concern (e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs, face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows, genitals). Some individuals are concerned about perceived asymmetry of body areas. The preoccupations are intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on average, 3-8 hours per day), and usually difficult to resist or control.Excessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts (e.g., comparing) are performed in re­sponse to the preoccupation (Criterion B). The individual feels driven to perform these be­haviors, which are not pleasurable and may increase anxiety and dysphoria. They are typically time-consuming and difficult to resist or control. Common behaviors are com­paring one's appearance with that of other individuals; repeatedly checking perceived defects in mirrors or other reflecting surfaces or examining them directly; excessively grooming (e.g., combing, styling, shaving, plucking, or pulling hair); camouflaging (e.g., repeatedly applying makeup or covering disliked areas with such things as a hat, clothing, makeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about how the perceived flaws look; touching dis­liked areas to check them; excessively exercising or weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic procedures. Some individuals excessively tan (e.g., to darken ""pale"" skin or diminish per­ceived acne), repeatedly change their clothes (e.g., to camouflage perceived defects), or compulsively shop (e.g., for beauty products). Compulsive skin picking intended to improve perceived skin defects is common and can cause skin damage, infections, or ruptured blood vessels. The preoccupation must cause clinically significant distress or im­pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C); usually both are present. Body dysmoφhic disorder must be differentiated from an eating disorder.Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmoφhic disorder occurring almost exclusively in males, consists of preoccupation with the idea that one's body is too small or insuffi­ciently lean or muscular. Individuals with this form of the disorder actually have a nor­mal-looking body or are even very muscular. They may also be preoccupied with other body areas, such as skin or hair. A majority (but not all) diet, exercise, and/or lift weights excessively, sometimes causing bodily damage. Some use potentially dangerous anabolic-androgenic steroids and other substances to try to make their body bigger and more mus­cular. Body dysmorphic disorder by proxy is a form of body dysmorphic disorder in which individuals are preoccupied with defects they perceive in another person's appear­ance.Insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs can range from good to absent/ delusional (i.e., delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction that the individual's view of their appearance is accurate and undistorted). On average, insight is poor; one- third or more of individuals currently have delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs. Individuals with delusional body dysmorphic disorder tend to have greater morbidity in some areas (e.g., suicidality), but this appears accounted for by their tendency to have more severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms.",
"42","Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)","The essential feature of trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is the recurrent pulling out of one's own hair (Criterion A). Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body in which hair grows; the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, while less common sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and peri-rectal regions. Hair-pulling sites may vary over time. Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or during less frequent but more sustained periods that can continue for hours, and such hairpulling may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that hair pulling lead to hair loss, although individuals with this disorder may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g., by using makeup, scarves, or wigs). Individuals with trichotillomania have made repeated at­tempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor­tant areas of functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be experi­enced by individuals with hair pulling, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning (e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work, school, or other public situations.",
"43","Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder","The essential feature of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder is recurrent picking at one's own skin (Criterion A). The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms, and hands, but many individuals pick from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at minor skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs from previous picking. Most individuals pick with their fingernails, although many use tweezers, pins, or other objects. In addition to skin picking, there may be skin rubbing, squeezing, lancing, and biting. Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of time on their picking behavior, sometimes several hours per day, and such skin picking mayendure for months or years. Criterion A requires that skin picking lead to skin lesions, al­though individu^als with this disorder often attempt to conceal or camouflage such lesions (e.g., with makeup or clothing). Individuals with excoriation disorder have made repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking (Criterion B).Criterion C indicates that skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impair­ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The term distress in­cludes negative affects that may be experienced by individuals with skin picking, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning (e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of social situations.",
"44","Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder","The essential features of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder are prominent symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (Criterion A) that are judged to be attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medica­tion). The obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication or toxin, and the substance/medication must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B). Sub­stance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the in­dividual is receiving the medication. Once the treatment is discontinued, the obsessive-com­pulsive and related disorder symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to 1 month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should not be given if onset of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms precedes the sub­stance intoxication or medication use, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time, usually longer than 1 month, from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms persist for a substantial period of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered. The substance/medication-induced ob­sessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxication only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention",
"45","Due to Another Medical Condition","The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition is clinically significant obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms that are judged to be best explained as the direct pathophysiological consequence of another med­ical condition. Symptoms can include prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccu­pations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical ex­amination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagno­sis is not made if the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other impor­tant areas of functioning (Criterion E).In determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are attribut­able to another medical condition, a relevant medical condition must be present. Further­more, it must be established that obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms can be etiologically related to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism and that this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms and the medical condition is etiological, considerations that may provide some guidance in making this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g., striatal dam­age) causes obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the disturbance cannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, a sub­stance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another men­tal disorder.There is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham's chorea is the neurolog­ical manifestation of rheumatic fever, which is in turn due to Group A streptococcal in­fection. Sydenham's chorea is characterized by a combination of motor and nonmotor features. Nonmotor features include obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit, and emo­tional lability. Although individuals ŵ ith Sydenham's chorea may present with non­neuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever, such as carditis and arthritis, they may present with obsessive-compulsive disorder-like symptoms; such individuals should be diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infec­tions (PANDAS) has been identified as another post-infectious autoimmune disorder characterized by the sudden onset of obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied by a variety of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of chorea, carditis, or ar­thritis, after Group A streptococcal infection. Although there is a body of evidence that supports the existence of PANDAS, it remains a controversial diagnosis. Given this ongo­ing controversy, the description of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate etiological factors and to designate an expanded clinical entity: pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiat­ric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS), which deserves further study.",
"46","Reactive Attachment Disorder","Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood is characterized by a pattern of markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behaviors, in which a child rarely or minimally turns preferentially to an attachment figure for comfort, support, protection, and nurturance. The essential feature is absent or grossly underdeveloped at­tachment between the child and putative caregiving adults. Children with reactive attach­ment disorder are believed to have the capacity to form selective attachments. However, because of limited opportunities during early development, they fail to show the behavioral manifestations of selective attachments. That is, when distressed, they show no consistent effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers. Furthermore, when distressed, children with this disorder do not respond more than minimally to com­forting efforts of caregivers. Thus, the disorder is associated with the absence of expected comfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such, children with reactive attachment disorder show diminished or absent expression of positive emotions during routine interactions with caregivers. In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is com­promised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear, sadness, or irritability that are not readily explained. A diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder should not be made in children who are developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.",
"47","Disinhiblted Social Engagement Disorder","The essential feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior that involves culturally inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with relative strangers (Criterion A). This overly familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made before children are developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.",
"48","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of char­acteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events. Emotional re­actions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of Criterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based re- experiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhe- donic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some other individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina­tions of these symptom patterns.The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g., physical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual violence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abu­sive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu­man-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces­sarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events in­volve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes­tic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one's child (e.g., a life- threatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to experiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or acciden­tal (e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per­sonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sex­ual violence). ^The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion Bl). Intrusive recollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply only to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent memories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral components. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the event itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states that last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo­ment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory intrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete loss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as ""flash­backs,"" are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play or in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re­activity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane; seeing someone who resembles one's perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously traumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations.Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e.g., always or almost always) avoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories, feelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid internal reminders) (Criterion Cl) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2).Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen after exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically due to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion Dl). Another form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex­pectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g., ""I have always had bad judgment""; ""People in authority can't be trusted"") that may man­ifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e.g., ""I can't trust anyone ever again""; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni­tions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others (e.g., ""It's all my fault that my uncle abused me"") (Criterion D3). A persistent negative mood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure to the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest or participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or es­tranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion D7).Individuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, get­ting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion El). They may also engage in reckless or self­destructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self- injurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2). PTSD is often characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentiallycaused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of suffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un­expected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri­terion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g., forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conver­sation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems with sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares and safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep (Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of de­tachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization); this is reflected in the ''with dissociative symptoms"" specifier.",
"49","Acute Stress Disorder","The essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of characteristic symp­toms lasting from 3 days to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events.Traumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, exposureto war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent personal assault (e.g., sexualviolence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical and/or sexual vio­lence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or human­made disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e.g., severe motor vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events may include inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe and traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjust­ment disorder but not to acute stress disorder.The clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically involves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to the traumatic event. In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can pre­dominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or phys­iological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a strong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggres­sive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the trau­matic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur immediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for acute stress disorder.Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious in­jury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a re­sult of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may also include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involv­ing one's child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited to close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental—death due to natural causes does not qualify—and include violent personal assault, suicide, se­rious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this dis­order may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase.The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion Bl). The recollections are spontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response to a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring car triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory (e.g., sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experi­encing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., expe­riencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components.Distressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically re­lated to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a motor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars gener­ally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in ways other than combat.)Dissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experi­encing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a trau­matic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure are considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments (e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during play in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks, are typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present rather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress.Some individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself, but instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when they are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or fe­male who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one's perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat for a bum victim, diz­ziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic pre­sentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g., happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexual­ity) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame.Alterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g., seeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of one's surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things in a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals also report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was presumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not at­tributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse to discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions (e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the ex­perience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of the traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or avoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience.It is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems with sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with gen­eralized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress dis­order may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a height­ened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic ex­perience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat potentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., fear of having a heart attack). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g., forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individ­uals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., the individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing).",
"50","Adjustment Disorders","The presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor is the essential feature of adjustment disorders (Criterion A). The stressor may be a single event (e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there may be multiple stressors (e.g., marked business difficulties and marital problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous (e.g., a persistent painful illness with increasing disability, living in a crime-ridden neigh­borhood). Stressors may affect a single individual, an entire family, or a larger group or community (e.g., a natural disaster). Some stressors may accompany specific developmen­tal events (e.g., going to school, leaving a parental home, reentering a parental home, get­ting married, becoming a parent, failing to attain occupational goals, retirement).Adjustment disorders may be diagnosed following the death of a loved one when the intensity, quality, or persistence of grief reactions exceeds what normally might be ex­pected, when cultural, religious, or age-appropriate norms are taken into account. A more specific set of bereavement-related symptoms has been designated persistent complex be­reavement disorder.Adjustment disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts and completed suicide.",
"51","Stressor-Related Disorder","The defining feature of dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more dis­tinct personality states or an experience of possession (Criterion A). The overtness or covertness of these personality states, however, varies as a function of psychological motivation, current level of stress, culture, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional resilience. Sustained periods of identity disruption may occur when psychosocial pres­sures are severe and/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity disorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, manifestations of alter­nate identities are highly overt. Most individuals with non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder do not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of time; only a small minority present to clinical attention with observable alternation ofidentities. When alternate personality states are not directly observed, the disorder can be identified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of self and sense οί agency (Criterion A), and 2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B).Criterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any aspect of an individual's functioning. Individuals v̂ ith dissociative identity disorder may report the feeling that they have suddenly become depersonalized observers of their ""own"" speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (sense of self). Such in­dividuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child's voice; crying; the voice of a spiritual being). In some cases, voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, indepen­dent thought streams over which the individual experiences no control. Strong emotions, impulses, and even speech or other actions may suddenly emerge, without a sense of per­sonal ownership or control (sense of agency). These emotions and impulses are frequently reported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences (e.g., about food, activities, dress) may suddenly shift and then shift back. Individuals may report that their bodies feel different (e.g., like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge and muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be accompa­nied by a feeling that these attitudes, emotions, and behaviors—even one's body—are ""not mine"" and/or are ""not under my control."" Although most Criterion A symptoms are subjective, many of these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior can be wit­nessed by family, friends, or the clinician. Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion symptoms are prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder, espe­cially in some non-Westem settings.The dissociative amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifests in three primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of personal life events (e.g., periods of childhood or adolescence; some important life events, such as the death of a grandparent, getting married, giving birth); 2) lapses in dependable memory (e.g., of what happened today, of well-leamed skills such as how to do their job, use a computer, read, drive); and 3) discovery of evidence of their everyday actions and tasks that they do not recollect do­ing (e.g., finding unexplained objects in their shopping bags or among their possessions; finding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries; ""coming to"" in the midst of doing something). Dissociative fugues, wherein the person discovers dissociated travel, are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity dis­order may report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a night­club, or somewhere at home (e.g., in the closet, on a bed or sofa, in the corner) with no memory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity dis­order is not limited to stressful or traumatic events; these individuals often cannot recall everyday events as well.Individuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness and attitude to­ward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals to minimize their amnestic symp­toms. Some of their amnestic behaviors may be apparent to others—as when these persons do not recall something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot remember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse, children, or close friends.Possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as be­haviors that appear as if a ""spirit,"" supernatural being, or outside person has taken control, such that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For ex­ample, an individual's behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been replaced by the ""ghost"" of a girl who committed suicide in the same community years before, speaking and acting as though she were still alive. Or an individual may be ""taken over"" by a demon or deity, resulting in profound impairment, and demanding that the in­dividual or a relative be punished for a past act, followed by more subtle periods of iden­tity alteration. However, the majority of possession states around the world are normal, usually part of spiritual practice, and do not meet criteria for dissociative identity disor-der. The identities that arise during possession-form dissociative identity disorder present recurrently, are unvŝ anted and involuntary, cause clinically significant distress or impair­ment (Criterion C), and are not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice (Criterion D).",
"52","Stressor-Related Disorder","",
"53","Dissociative Amnesia","The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important auto­biographical information that 1) should be successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinar­ily would be readily remembered (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the permanent amnesias due to neurobiological damage or toxicity that prevent memory stor­age or retrieval in that it is always potentially reversible because the memory has been suc­cessfully stored.Localized amnesia, a failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time, is the most common form of dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia may be broader than am­nesia for a single traumatic event (e.g., months or years associated with child abuse or in­tense combat). In selective amnesia, the individual can recall some, but not all, of the events during a circumscribed period of time. Thus, the individual may remember part of a trau­matic event but not other parts. Some individuals report both localized and selective am­nesias.Generalized amnesia, a complete loss of memory for one's life history, is rare. Individuals with generalized amnesia may forget personal identity. Some lose previous knowledge about the world (i.e., semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, dis­orientation, an4 purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually bring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized amnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and indi­viduals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict.Individuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only partially aware) of their memory problems. Many, especially those with localized amnesia, minimize the importance of their memory loss and may become uncomfortable when prompted to ad­dress it. In systematized amnesia, the individual loses memory for a specific category of in­formation (e.g., all memories relating to one's family, a particular person, or childhood sexual abuse). In continuous amnesia, an individual forgets each new event as it occurs.",
"54","Depersonalization/Dereallzation Disorder","The essential features of depersonalization/derealization disorder are persistent or recur­rent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one's whole self or from aspects of the self (Criterion Al). The individual may feel detached from his or her entire being (e.g., ""I am no one,"" ""I have no self""). He or she may also feel subjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality:""I know I have feelings but I don't feel them""), thoughts (e.g., ""My thoughts don't feel like my own,"" ""head^filled with cotton""), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch, proprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency (e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one's speech or movements). The depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part ob­serving and one participating, known as an ""out-of-body experience"" in its most extreme form. The unitary symptom of ""depersonalization"" consists of several symptom factors: anomalous body experiences (i.e., unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emo­tional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall.Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surround­ings (Criterion A2). TTie individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surround­ings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly ac­companied by subjective visual distortions, such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened or narrowed visual field, two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensional­ity, or altered distance or size of objects (i.e., macropsia or micropsia). Auditory distortions can also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted or heightened. In addition. Criterion C requires the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa­tional, or other important areas of fimctioning, and Criteria D and E describe exclusionary diagnoses.",
"55","Other Specified Dissociative Disorder","Individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple, current, somatic symp­toms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), al­though sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms may be specific (e.g., localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The symptoms sometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally sig­nify serious disease. Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not sufficient to make this diagnosis. The individual's suffering is authentic, whether or not it is medically explained.The symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical condition. The di­agnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually exclusive, and these frequently occur together. For example, an individual may become se­riously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myo­cardial infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability. If another medical condition or high risk for developing one is present (e.g., strong family history), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive (Criterion B).Individuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry about illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening, harmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health. Even when there is evidence to the contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symp­toms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in the individual's life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interper­sonal relationships.Individuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symp­toms and their significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals de­scribe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress other than the somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both physically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked, and when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism.There is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individ­ual's concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from multiple doctors for the same symptoms. These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new interventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the dis­order seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that their medical as­sessment and treatment have been inadequate.",
"56","Unspecified Dissociative Disorder","",
"57","Illness Anxiety Disorder","Most individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having somatic symptom disorder; however, in a minority of cases, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder applies instead. Illness anxiety disorder entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a seri­ous, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a serious medical condition that accounts for the individual's concerns. While the concern may be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual's dis­tress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her anxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i.e., the suspected med­ical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g., transient tinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belch­ing). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual's anxiety and preoccu­pation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion B). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to previously defined DSM hypo­chondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the descrip­tion of this new diagnosis.The preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety about health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are easilyalarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health- related news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appro­priate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course. The physician's at­tempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual's concerns and may heighten them. Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the indi­vidual's life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism. Illness becomes a central feature of the individual's identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social dis­course, and a characteristic response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder often examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., examining one's throat in the mirror) (Crite­rion D). They research their suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and re­peatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often becomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family. In some cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick family members) or activities (e.g., exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize their health.",
"58","(Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)","Many clinicians use the alternative names of ""functional"" (referring to abnormal central nervous system functioning) or ""psychogenic"" (referring to an assumed etiology) to de­scribe the symptoms of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disor­der). In conversion disorder, there may be one or more symptoms of various types. Motor symptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor or dys­tonie movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnor­mal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of consciousness may resem­ble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures). There may be episodes of unresponsiveness resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include re­duced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a sensation of a lump in the throat (globus), and diplopia.Although the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological disease, it should not be made simply because results from investigations are normal or because the symptom is ""bizarre."" There must be clinical findings that show clear evidence of incompatibility with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one way to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical signs elicited through one examination method are no longer positive when tested a different way). Ex­amples of such examination findings include• Hoover's sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to normal strength with con­tralateral hip flexion against resistance.• Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an individual who is able to walk on tiptoes;• Positive findings on the tremor entrainment test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may be identified as functional if the tremor changes when the individual is distracted away from it. This may be observed if the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making a rhythmical movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional tremor to change such that it copies or ""entrains"" to the rhythm of the unaffected hand or the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer makes a simple rhythmical move­ment.• In attacks resembling epilepsy or syncope (""psychogenic"" non-epileptic attacks), the occurrence of closed eyes with resistance to opening or a normal simultaneous electro­encephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope).• For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision).It is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should be based on the overall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding.",
"59","Factitious Disorder","The essential feature of factitious disorder is the falsification of medical or psychological signs and symptoms in oneself or others that are associated with the identified deception. Indi­viduals with factitious disorder can also seek treatment for themselves or another following induction of injury or disease. The diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is taking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause signs or symptoms of ill­ness or injury in the absence of obvious external rewards. Methods of illness falsification can include exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, and induction. While a preexisting med­ical condition may be present, the deceptive behavior or induction of injury associated with deception causes others to view such individuals (or another) as more ill or impaired, and this can lead to excessive clinical intervention. Individuals with factitious disorder might, for example, report feelings of depression and suicidality following the death of a spouse despite the death not being true or the individual's not having a spouse; decep­tively report episodes of neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, dizziness, or blacking out); manipulate a laboratory test (e.g., by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnor­mality; falsify medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a substance (e.g., insulin or warfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; or physically injure them­selves or induce illness in themselves or anotiier (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce an abscess or to induce sepsis).",
"60","Related Disorder","The essential feature of pica is the eating of one or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances on a persistent basis over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A) that is severe enough to warrant clinical attention. Typical substances ingested tend to vary with age and availability and might include paper, soap, cloth, hair, string, wool, soil, chalk, talcum powder, paint, gum, metal, pebbles, charcoal or coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The term nonfood is included because the di­agnosis of pica does not apply to ingestion of diet products that have minimal nutritional con­tent. There is typically no aversion to food in general. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B) and not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice (Criterion C). A minimum age of 2 years is suggested for a pica diagnosis to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects by infants that re­sults in ingestion. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances can be an associated feature of other mental disorders (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia). If the eating behavior occurs exclusively in the con­text of another mental disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating behavior is sufficientiy severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D).",
"61","Related Disorder","",
"62","Rumination Disorder","The essential feature of rumination disorder is the repeated regurgitation of food occur­ring after feeding or eating over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A). Previously swal­lowed food that may be partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent nausea, involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and then ejected from the mouth or re-swallowed. Regurgitation in rumination disorder should be fre­quent, occurring at least several times per week, typically daily. The behavior is not better explained by an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesoph­ageal reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restric­tive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], neuro­developmental disorder), they must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D) and should represent a primary aspect of the individual's presen­tation requiring intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span, par­ticularly in individuals who also have intellectual disability. Many individuals with rumination disorder can be directly observed engaging in the behavior by the clinician. In other instances diagnosis can be made on the basis of self-report or corroborative informa­tion from parents or caregivers. Individuals may describe the behavior as habitual or out­side of their control.",
"63","Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder","Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The main diagnostic feature of avoidant/ restrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food intake (Criterion A) manifested by clinically significant failure to meet requirements for nutrition or insuffi­cient energy intake through oral intake of food. One or more of the following key features must be present: significant weight loss, significant nutritional deficiency (or related health impact), dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. The determination of whether weight loss is significant (Criterion Al) is a clinical judgment; instead of losing weight, children and ad­olescents who have not completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases along their developmental trajectory.Determination of significant nutritional deficiency (Criterion A2) is also based on clin­ical assessment (e.g., assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory testing), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar severity to that seen in anorexia nervosa (e.g., hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases, particularly in infants, malnutrition can be life threatening. ""Dependence"" on enteral feeding or oral nu­tritional supplements (Criterion A3) means that supplementary feeding is required to sus­tain adequate intake. Examples of individuals requiring supplementary feeding include infants with failure to thrive who require nasogastric tube feeding, children with neuro- developmental disorders who are dependent on nutritionally complete supplements, and individuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements in the absence of an underlying medical condition. Inability to participate in normal socialactivities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationships as a result of the distur­bance would inculcate marked interference with psychosocial functioning (Criterion A4).Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or restriction of food intake related to lack of availability of food or to cultural practices (e.g., religious fast­ing or normal dieting) (Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors (e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). The disturbance is not better explained by excessive concern about body weight or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent medical factors or mental disorders (Criterion D).In some individuals, food avoidance or restriction may be based on the sensory char­acteristics of qualities of food, such as extreme sensitivity to appearance, color, smell, texture, temperature, or taste. Such behavior has been described as ""restrictive eating,"" ""selective eating,"" ""choosy eating,"" ""perseverant eating,"" ""chronic food refusal,"" and ""food neophobia"" and may manifest as refusal to eat particular brands of foods or to tol­erate the smell of food being eaten by others. Individuals with heightened sensory sensi­tivities associated with autism may show similar behaviors.Food avoidance or restriction may also represent a conditioned negative response as­sociated with food intake following, or in anticipation of, an aversive experience, such as choking; a traumatic investigation, usually involving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esoph- agoscopy); or repeated vomiting. The terms frinctional dysphagia and globus hystericus have also been used for such conditions.",
"64","Anorexia Nervosa","There are three essential features of anorexia nervosa: persistent energy intake restriction; intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain; and a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual main­tains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental tra­jectory, and physical health (Criterion A). Individuals' body weights frequently meet this criterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there may alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal devel­opmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead of weight loss.Criterion A requires that the individual's weight be significantly low (i.e., less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected). Weight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi­viduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight status. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters^) is a useful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m  ̂has been employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m  ̂would not be considered to have a significantly low body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m  ̂has been considered by the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI less than 17.0 kg/m  ̂would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An adult with a BMI between 17.0 and 18.5 kg/m ,̂ or even above 18.5 kg/m , might be consid­ered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa­tion supports this judgment.For children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g., the CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos­sible to provide definitive standards forjudging whether a child's or an adolescent's weight is significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the utility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per­centile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above this benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main­tain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is met, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual's body build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances.Individuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by weight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger individuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or acknowl­edge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation for the significantly low weight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observational data, physical and laboratory findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain or sup­porting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to establish Criterion B.The experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these indi­viduals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they are thin but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks, and thighs, are ""too fat."" They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body size or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and per­sistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of ""fat."" The self-esteem of individuals with anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight. Weight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self­discipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Al­though some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do not recognize the serious medical implications of their malnourished state.Often, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked weight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help on their own, it is usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae of starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss per se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny the problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or other sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness.",
"65","Bulimia Nervosa","There are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating (Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (Criterion B), and self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight (Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensa­tory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).An ""episode of binge eating"" is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances (Criterion Al). The context in which the eating occursmay affect the clinician's estimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be consid­ered normal during a celebration or holiday meal. A ""discrete period of time"" refers to a limited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be re­stricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be considered an eating binge.An occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack of control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss of control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some indi­viduals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The impairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but rather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they have abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as present. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances.The type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges, individuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid.Individuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspic­uously as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably, or even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect. Other triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related to body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit­igate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation and dysphoria often are the delayed consequences.Another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate com­pensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or purging (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to compensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory behavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and re­duction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the individual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, includ­ing the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally become adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, indi­viduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be used in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi­sodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individ­uals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent weight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with im­portant activities, when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications.Individuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape or weight in their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically extremely important in determiningself-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those ŵ ith anorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire to lose weight, and in the level of dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should not be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Cri­terion E).",
"66","Binge-Eating Disorder","The essential feature of binge-eating disorder is recurrent episodes binge eating that must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion D).

"67","Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder","The essential feature of enuresis is repeated voiding of urine during the day or at night into bed or clothes (Criterion A). Most often the voiding is involuntary, but occasionally it maybe intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of enuresis, the voiding of urine must occur at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or must cause clinically significant dis­tress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of func­tioning (Criterion B). The individual must have reached an age at which continence is expected (i.e., a chronological age of at least 5 years or, for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at least 5 years) (Criterion C). The urinary incontinence is not at­tributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic med­ication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder) (Criterion D).",
"68","Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder","",
"69","Encopresis","The essential feature of encopresis is repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing or floor) (Criterion A). Most often the passage is involimtary but occasionally may be intentional. The event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months (Criterion B), and the chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years (or for children with developmental delays, the mental age must be at least 4 years) (Criterion C). The fecal incontinence must not be exclusively attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation (Criterion D).When the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional, it is often related to constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. The constipation may develop for psychological reasons (e.g., anxiety about defecating in a particular place, a more general pattern of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of defeca­tion. Physiological predispositions to constipation include ineffectual straining or paradox­ical defecation dynamics, with contraction rather than relaxation of the external sphincter or pelvic floor during straining for defecation. Dehydration associated with a febrile ill­ness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side effect can also induce constipation. Once con­stipation has developed, it may be complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation, and further fecal retention. The consistency of the stool may vary. In some individuals the stool may be of normal or near-normal consistency. In other individuals—such as those with overflow incontinence secondary to fecal retention—it may be liquid.",
"70","Insomnia Disorder","The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality with complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are ac­companied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The sleep disturbance may occur during the course of an­other mental disorder or medical condition, or it may occur independently.Different manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the sleep period. Sleep- onset insomnia (or initial insomnia) involves difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. Sleep mainte­nance insomnia (or middle insomnia) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout the night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep. Difficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of insomnia, followed by difficulty falling asleep, while a combination of these symptoms is the most common presen­tation overall. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who complain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep can be quantified by the individual's retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods, such as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on the individual's subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker's report.Nonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual rested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually occurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in isolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs in isolation (i.e., in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all di­agnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments are otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insom­nia disorder is made.Aside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi­tional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while arbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep is defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20-30 minutes, and difficulty maintain­ing sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20-30 min­utes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom involves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep time reaches hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time but also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the same clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at 11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sus­tain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period.Insomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties. These include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common among older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition (e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance may include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing simple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or mood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with nighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep continuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves as good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals with significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.",
"71","Hypersomnolence Disorder","Hypersomnolence is a broad diagnostic term and includes symptoms of excessive quantity of sleep (e.g., extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality of wakefulness (i.e., sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by difficulty awaken­ing or inability to remain awake when required), and sleep inertia (i.e., a period of im­paired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular sleep episode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and have a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning, sometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alert­ness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (i.e., sleep drunkenness). It can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual appears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappro­priate, and memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of grogginess may occur. This period may last some minutes to hours.The persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a very routine, low-complexity type) that the individual carries out with little or no subsequent recall. For example, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they thought they were, unaware of the ""automatic"" driving they did in the preceding minutes. For some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most individuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often nonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individ­uals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep duration (6-9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several un­intentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour or more), are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead to improved alertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps nearly everyday regard­less of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as good. Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather thanexperiencing a sudden sleep ""attack."" Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in low- stimulation and low-activity situations (e.g., while attending lectures, reading, watching television, or driving long distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high- attention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.",
"72","Narcolepsy","The essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week for at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most commonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus­cle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may include those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw dropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet Criterion Bl(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least a few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past.Cataplexy should not be confused with ''weakness"" occurring in the context of athletic activities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or anxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not triggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh­ing hysterically.In children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the face, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (""cataplectic faces""). Alter­natively, cataplexy may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling walk. In these cases. Criterion Bl(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months of a rapid onset.Narcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin)-producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of control values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap­proximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQBl*06:02 (vs. 12%-38% of control subjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for eval­uation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypo­cretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF hypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe con­ditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay.A nocturnal polysonrmographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to confirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual has stopped all psychotropic medications, following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as documented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency (sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom­nography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the MSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 min­utes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps.",
"73","Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea","Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder. It is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airŵ ay obstruction (apneas and hypopneas) during sleep. Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea re­fers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing of at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi­cally associated with drops in oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph- alographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common. The cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime sleepiness.Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of polysom- nographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal breathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or 2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient opportunities to sleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an­other medical condition, along with 3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more ob­structive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion Al). Diagnosis can be made in the absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob­structive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A2).Specific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing pauses and physical findings that increase risk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., central obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce the chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.",
"74","Central Sleep Apnea","Central sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hy- popneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort. These are disorders of ventilatory control in which respiratory events occur in a periodic or intermittent pattern. Idiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness, insomnia, and awakenings due to dyspnea in association with five or more central apneas per hour of sleep. Central sleep apnea occurring in individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have a breathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes breathing, which is characterized by a pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompa­nied by frequent arousals. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist; the ratio of central to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to identify which condition is pre­dominant.Alterations in neuromuscular control of breathing can occur in association with med­ications or substances used in individuals with mental health conditions, which can cause or exacerbate impairments of respiratory rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these medications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep distur­bances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression. Specifically, chronicuse of long-acting opioid medications is often associated with impairment of respiratory con­trol leading to central sleep apnea.",
"75","Sleep-Related Hypoventilation","Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently or, more frequently, comorbid with medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder. Al­though symptoms are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during sleep, morning headaches, and insomnia complaints.",
"76","Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders","The delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake- up time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set their own schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep qual­ity and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep-onset insomnia, difficulty waking in the morning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent.",
"77","Sleep Arousal Disorders","The essential feature of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders is the repeated occurrence of incomplete arousals, usually beginning during the first third of the major sleep episode (Criterion A), that typically are brief, lasting 1-10 minutes, but may be protracted, lasting up to 1 hour. The maximum duration of an event is unknown. The eyes are typically open during these events. Many individuals exhibit both subtypes of arousals on different occasions, which underscores the unitary underlying pathophysiology. The subtypes reflect varying degrees of simultaneous occurrence of wakefulness and NREM sleep, resulting in complex behaviors arising from sleep with varying degrees of conscious awareness, motor activity, and autonomic activation.The essential feature of sleepwalking is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about (Criterion Al). Sleep­walking episodes begin during any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly during slow- wave sleep and therefore most often occurring during the first third of the night. During episodes, the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness, a blank stare, and rel­ative unresponsiveness to communication with others or efforts by others to awaken the individual. If awakened during the episode (or on awakening the following morning), the individual has limited recall for the episode. After the episode, there may initially be a brief period of confusion or difficulty orienting, followed by full recovery of cognitive function and appropriate behavior.The essential feature of sleep terrors is the repeated occurrence of precipitous awaken­ings from sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream or cry (Criterion A2). Sleep ter­rors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep episode and last 1-10 minutes, but they may last considerably longer, particularly in children. The episodes are accom­panied by impressive autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear. During an episode, the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort. If the individual awak­ens after the sleep terror, little or none of the dream, or only fragmentary, single images, are recalled. During a typical episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in bed screaming or crying, with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of intense anx­iety (e.g., tachycardia, rapid breathing, sweating, dilation of the pupils). The individual may be inconsolable and is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or com­fort him or her. Sleep terrors are also called ""night terrors"" or ""pavor nocturnus.""",
"78","Nightmare Disorder","Nightmares are typically lengthy, elaborate, story like sequences of dream imagery that seem real and that incite anxiety, fear, or other dysphoric emotions. Nightmare content typically focuses on attempts to avoid or cope with imminent danger but may involve themes that evoke other negative emotions. Nightmares occurring after traumatic experi­ences may replicate the threatening situation (""'replicative nightmares""), but most do not. On awakening, nightmares are well remembered and can be described in detail. They arisealmost exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can thus occur through­out sleep but are; more likely in the second half of the major sleep episode when dreaming is longer and more intense. Factors that increase early-night REM intensity, such as sleep fragmentation or deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate nightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset.Nightmares usually terminate with awakening and rapid return of full alertness. How­ever, the dysphoric emotions may persist into wakefulness and contribute to difficulty re­turning to sleep and lasting daytime distress. Some nightmares, known as ""bad dreams,"" may not induce awakening and are recalled only later. If nightmares occur during sleep- onset REM periods (hypnagogic), the dysphoric emotion is frequently accompanied by a sense of being both awake and unable to move voluntarily {isolated sleep paralysis).",
"79","Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder","The essential feature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is repeated episodes of arousal, often associated with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors arising from REM sleep (Criterion A). These behaviors often reflect motor responses to the content of action-filled or violent dreams of being attacked or trying to escape from a threatening situation, which may be termed dream enacting behaviors. The vocalizations are often loud, emotion-filled, and profane. These behaviors may be very bothersome to the individual and the bed partner and may result in significant injury (e.g., falling, jumping, or flying out of bed; running, punching, thrusting, hitting, or kicking). Upon awakening, the individual is immediately awake, alert, and oriented (Criterion C) and is often able to recall dream mentation, which closely correlates with the observed behavior. The eyes typically remain closed during these events. The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disor­der requires clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion E); this determination will depend on a number of factors, including the frequency of events, the potential for vi­olence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment, and distress in other household members.",
"80","Restless Legs Syndrome","Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor, neurological sleep disorder characterized by a desire to move the legs or arms, usually associated with uncomfortable sensations typically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching (Criterion A). The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history. Symptoms are worse when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort to relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and in some individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening occurs in­dependently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other conditions such as positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D).The symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and are associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained from moving the legs may no longer be apparent in severe cases. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness and is frequently accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment.",
"81","Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder","The essential feature of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is a prominent sleep disturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention (Criterion A) and that is judged to be primarily associated with the pharmacological effects of a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, toxin exposure) (Criterion B). Depending on the sub­stance involved, one of four types of sleep disturbances is reported. Insomnia type and day­time sleepiness type are most common, while parasomnia type is seen less often. The mixed type is noted when more than one type of sleep disturbance-related symptom is present and none predominates. The disturbance must not be better explained by another sleep disorder (Criterion C). A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from insom­nia disorder or a disorder associated with excessive daytime sleepiness by considering onset and course. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder arises only in association with intoxication or discontinuation/withdrawal states, whereas other sleep disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during times of sustained abstinence. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for some substances can be protracted, onset of the sleep disturbance can occur 4 weeks after cessation of sub­stance use, and the disturbance may have features atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course). The diagnosis is not made if the sleep disturbance occurs only during a delirium (Criterion D). The symptoms must cause clinically significant dis­tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Crite­rion E). This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when the symptoms warrant independent clinical attention.",
"82","Other Specified Insomnia Disorder","The distinguishing feature of delayed ejaculation is a marked delay in or inability to achieve ejaculation (Criterion A). The man reports difficulty or inability to ejaculate de­spite the presence of adequate sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The present­ing complaint usually involves partnered sexual activity. In most cases, the diagnosis will be made by self-report of the individual. The definition of ""delay"" does not have precise boundaries, as there is noconsensus as to what constitutes a reasonable time to reach or­gasm or what is unacceptably long for most men and their sexual partners.",

"88","Erectile Disorder","The essential feature of erectile disorder is the repeated failure to obtain or maintain erec­tions during partnered sexual activities (Criterion A). A careful sexual history is necessary to ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e., at least approximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i.e., at least 75% of the time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving certain types of stimulation or partners, or they may occur in a generalized manner in all types of situa­tions, stimulation, or partners.",
"89","Female Orgasmic Disorder","Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations (Criterion A). Women show wide vari­ability in the type or intensity of stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly, subjective descrip­tions of orgasm are extremely varied, suggesting that it is experienced in very different ways, both across women and on different occasions by the same woman. For a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all (approx­imately 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts) and have a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. The use of the minimum severity and duration criteria is intended to distinguish transient orgasm difficulties from more persistent orgasmic dysfunction. The inclusion of ""approx­imately"" in Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the recommended 6-month threshold.For a woman to have a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, clinically significant dis­tress must accompany the symptoms (Criterion C). In many cases of orgasm problems, the causes are multifactorial or cannot be determined. If female orgasmic disorder is deemed to be better explained by another mental disorder, the effects of a substance/medication, or a medical condition, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Finally, if interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship dis­tress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are present, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.Many women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, and a relatively small pro­portion of women report that they always experience orgasm during penile-vaginal inter­course. Thus, a woman's experiencing orgasm through clitoral stimulation but not during intercourse does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It is also important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the result of inadequate sex­ual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.",
"90","Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder","In assessing female sexual interest/arousal disorder, interpersonal context must be taken into account. A ""desire discrepancy,"" in which a woman has lower desire for sexual activ­ity than her partner, is not sufficient to diagnose female sexual interest/arousal disorder. In order for the criteria for the disorder to be met, there must be absence or reduced fre­quency or intensity of at least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom profiles across women, as well as variability in how sexual interest and arousal are expressed. For exam­ple, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal disorder may be expressed as a lack of interest in sexual activity, an absence of erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance to initiate sexual activity and respond to a partner's sexual invitations. In another woman, an inability to be­come sexually excited, to respond to sexual stimuli with sexual desire, and a correspond-ing lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary features. Because sexual desire and arousal frequently coexist and are elicited in response to adequate sexual cues, the criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in desire and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of women with this disorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or arousal are common and may be adaptive responses to events in a woman's life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of approximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a persistent problem. The estimation of persistence may be determined by clinical judgment when a duration of 6 months cannot be ascertained precisely.There may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of interest in sexual activity (Crite­rion Al), which was previously termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The frequency or inten­sity of sexual and erotic thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The expression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include memories of past sexual experiences. The normative decline in sexual thoughts with age should be taken into account when this criterion is being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual activ­ity and of receptivity to a partner's sexual invitations (Criterion A3) is a behaviorally focused criterion. A couple's beliefs and preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to the assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure during sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75%-100%) sexual encounters (Cri­terion A4). Lack of pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low de­sire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual or erotic cues that elicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a lack of ""responsive desire""). Assessment of the adequacy of sexual stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with responsive sex­ual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of genital or nongenital sensations during sex­ual activity may be reduced or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal lubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of genital sexual response do not differentiate women who report sexual arousal concerns from those who do not, the self­report of reduced or absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient.For a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made, clinically signif­icant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion A. Distress may be experienced as a result of the lack of sexual interest Arousal or as a result of significant interference in a woman's life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better explained by one's self-identification as ""asexual,"" then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disor­der would not be made.",
"91","Genlto-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder","Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder refers to four commonly comorbid symptom di­mensions: 1) difficulty having intercourse, 2) genito-pelvic pain, 3) fear of pain or vaginal penetration, and 4) tension of the pelvic floor muscles (Criterion A). Because major diffi­culty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically sig­nificant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one symptom dimension. However, all four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a diagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension.Marked dijficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration (Criterion Al) can vary from a total in­ability to experience vaginal penetration in any situation (e.g., intercourse, gynecological ex­aminations, tampon insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one situation and but not in another. Although the most common clinical situation is when a woman is un­able to experience intercourse or penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing re­quired gynecological examinations may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts (Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in differ­ent locations in the genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be assessed. Typically, pain can be characterized as superficial (vulvovaginal or occurring during penetra­tion) or deep (pelvic; i.e., not felt until deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often not linearly related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse or other sexual activities. Some genito-pelvic pain only occurs when provoked (i.e., by intercourse or mechanical stim-Illation); other genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as provoked. Genito-pelvic pain can also be usefully characterized qualitatively (e.g., ""burning,"" ""cutting,"" ""shooting,"" ""throb­bing""). The pain may persist for a period after intercourse is completed and may also occur during urination. Typically, the pain experienced during sexual intercourse can be reproduced during a gynecological examination.Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during, or as a result of vaginal penetration (Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have regularly experienced pain during sexual intercourse. This ""normal"" reaction may lead to avoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this marked fear does not appear to be closely related to the experience of pain but nonetheless leads to avoidance of inter­course and vaginal penetration situations. Some have described this as similar to a phobic reaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain.Marked tensing or tightening o f the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration (Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to at­tempted vaginal entry to ""normal/voluntary"" muscle guarding in response to the antici­pated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of ""normal/ guarding"" reactions, penetration may be possible under circumstances of relaxation. The characterization and assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction is often best undertaken by a specialist gynecologist or by a pelvic floor physical therapist.",
"92","Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder","When an assessment for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is being made, inter­personal context must be taken into account. A ""desire discrepancy,"" in which a man has lower desire for sexual activity than his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypo­active sexual desire disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and deficient/absent sexual thoughts or fantasies are required for a diagnosis of the disorder. There may be variation across men in how sexual desire is expressed.The lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies must be per­sistent or recurrent and must occur for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. The inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard against making a diagnosis in cases in which a man's low sexual desire may represent an adaptive response to adverse life conditions (e.g., concern about a partner's pregnancy when the man is considering ter­minating the relationship). The introduction of ""approximately"" in Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the recommended 6-month threshold.",
"93","Premature (Early) Ejaculation","Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ejaculation that occurs prior to or shortly af­ter vaginal penetration, operationalized by an individual's estimate of ejaculatory latency (i.e., elapsed time before ejaculation) after vaginal penetration. Estimated and measured intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the ejaculatory latency is of short duration; therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for diagnostic puφoses. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in heterosexual men. There are insufficient data to determine if this duration criterion can be applied to ac­quired premature (early) ejaculation. The durational definition may apply to males of varying sexual orientations, since ejaculatory latencies appear to be similar across men of different sexual orientations and across different sexual activities.",
"94","Sexual Dysfunction","The major feature is a disturbance in sexual function that has a temporal relationship with substance/medication initiation, dose increase, or substance/medication discontinuation.",
"95","Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction","Individuals with gender dysphoria have a marked incongruence between the gender they have been assigned to (usually at birth, referred to as natal gender) and their experienced/ expressed gender. This discrepancy is the core component of the diagnosis. There must also be evidence of distress about this incongruence. Experienced gender may include al­ternative gender identities beyond binary stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not limited to a desire to simply be of the other gender, but may include a desire to be of an al­ternative gender, provided that it differs from the individual's assigned gender.Gender dysphoria manifests itself differently in different age groups. Prepubertal natal girls with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a boy, assert they are a boy, or as­sert they will grow up to be a man. They prefer boys' clothing and hairstyles, are often perceived by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a boy's name. Usually, they dis­play intense negative reactions to parental attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire. Some may refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes are required. These girls may demonstrate marked cross-gender identification in role-playing, dreams, and fantasies. Contact sports, rough-and-tumble play, traditional boyhood games, and boys as playmates are most often preferred. They show little interest in stereotypically feminine toys (e.g., dolls) or activities (e.g., feminine dress-up or role-play). Occasionally, they refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal girls may express a desire to have a penis or claim to have a penis or that they will grow one when older. They may also state that they do not want to develop breasts or menstruate.Prepubertal natal boys with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a girl or as­sert they are a girl or that they will grow up to be a woman. They have a preference for dressing in girls' or women's clothes or may improvise clothing from available materials (e.g., using towels, aprons, and scarves for long hair or skirts). These children may role- play female figures (e.g., playing ""mother"") and often are intensely interested in female fantasy figures. Traditional feminine activities, stereotypical games, and pastimes (e.g., ""playing house""; drawing feminine pictures; watching television or videos of favorite fe­male characters) are most often preferred. Stereotypical female-type dolls (e.g.. Barbie) are often favorite toys, and girls are their preferred playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble play and competitive sports and have little interest in stereotypically masculine toys (e.g., cars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a penis and insist on sitting to urinate. Morerarely, they may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting, that they wish them re­moved, or that they have, or wish to have, a vagina.In young adolescents with gender dysphoria, clinical features may resemble those of children or adults with the condition, depending on developmental level. As secondary sex characteristics of young adolescents are not yet fully developed, these individuals may not state dislike of them, but they are concerned about imminent physical changes.In adults with gender dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced gender and physical sex characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be rid of primary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some pri­mary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. To varying degrees, adults with gender dysphoria may adopt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experi­enced gender. They feel uncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in soci­ety, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a different gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner certainty to feel and re­spond as the experienced gender without seeking medical treatment to alter body char­acteristics. They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/ expressed and assigned gender by partially living in the desired role or by adopting a gen­der role neither conventionally male nor conventionally female.",

"97","Other Specified Gender Dysphoria","The essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion A). It is not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behav­ioral features of the disorder without problems of negative mood. However, individuals with the disorder who show the angry/irritable mood symptoms typically show the be­havioral features as well.The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting, and this is most frequently the home. Individuals who show enough symptoms to meet the diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at home, may be significantly impaired in their social functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are pres­ent in multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an indicator of the severity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual's behavior be assessed across mul­tiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they must be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings. Also, because symptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination.The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in individu­als without this disorder. There are several key considerations for determining if the be­haviors are symptomatic of oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold of four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the per­sistence and frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an individ­ual's age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to show temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be considered a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most days for the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the dis­order, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the significant impairment associated with the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the child being asked to leave a preschool).The symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic interactions with others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves as angry, oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to unreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the rela­tive contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or she experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have ex­perienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the child's behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the parents' hostility led to the child's problematic behavior, or if there was some combination of both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of potential causal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that the child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may occur (e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the environment may be helpful.",

"99","Intermittent Explosive Disorder","The impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid onset and, typically, little or no prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for lessthan 30 minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by a close intimate or associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder often have less severe epi­sodes of verbal and/or nondamaging, nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Cri­terion Al) in between more severe destructive/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2). Criterion A1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months) aggressive out­bursts characterized by temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault without damage to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion A2 defines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year period) impulsive aggressive outbursts character­ized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting/ striking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual. Regard­less of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core feature of intermittent explosive disorder is failure to control impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjec­tively experienced provocation (i.e., psychosocial stressor) that would not typically result in an aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts are generally impulsive and/ or anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated with significant distress or impairment in psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6 years, or the equivalent developmental level (Criterion E), or to individuals whose aggressive out­bursts are better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermit­tent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive outbursts are attribut­able to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F). In addition, children ages 6-18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive ag­gressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F).",
"100","Conduct Disorder","The essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are vi­olated (Criterion A). These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct that causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria A1-A7); non­aggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage (Criteria A8-A9); deceitfulness or theft (Criteria A10-A12); and serious violations of rules (Criteria A13-A15). Three or more characteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months, with at least one behavior present in the past 6 months. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The behavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as home, at school, or in the community. Because individuals with conduct disorder are likely to minimize their conduct problems, the clinician often must rely on additional informants. However, infor­mants' knowledge of the individual's conduct problems may be limited if they have inad­equately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed symptom behaviors.Individuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggres­sively to others. They may display bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior (includ­ing bullying via messaging on Web-based social media) (Criterion Al); initiate frequent physical fights (Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3); be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4) or animals (Criterion A5); steal while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity (Criterion AT). Physical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate destruction of others' property may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of caus­ing serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other people's property in other ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandalizing school property) (Criterion A9). Acts of deceitfulness or theft may include breaking into someone else's house, building, or car (Crite­rion AlO); frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts or obligations (e.g., ""conning"" other individuals) (Criterion A ll); or stealing items of non­trivial value without confronting the victim (e.g., shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12).Individuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit serious violations of rules (e.g., school, parental, workplace). Children with conduct disorder often have a pat­tern, beginning before age 13 years, of staying out late at night despite parental prohi­bitions (Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from home overnight (Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct disorder, the running away must have occurred at least twice (or only once if the individual did not return for a lengthy period). Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sex­ual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may often be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion A15).",
"101","Pyromania","The essential feature of pyromania is the presence of multiple episodes of deliberate and purposeful fire setting (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder experience tension or af­fective arousal before setting a fire (Criterion B). There is a fascination with, interest in, cu­riosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences) (Criterion C). Individuals with this disorder are often regular ""watchers"" at fires in their neighborhoods, may set off false alarms, and derive pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire. They may spend time at the local fire depart­ment, set fires to be affiliated with the fire department, or even become firefighters. Individ­uals with this disorder experience pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting the fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath (Criterion D). The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal ac­tivity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one's living circumstances, or in response to a delusion or a hallucination (Criterion E). The fire setting does not result from impaired judgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder or intellectual disability [intellectual devel­opmental disorder]). The diagnosis is not made if the fire setting is better explained by con­duct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion F).",
"102","Kleptomania","The essential feature of kleptomania is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items even though the items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value (Criterion A). The individual experiences a rising subjective sense of tension before the theft (Criterion B) and feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when committing the theft (Criterion C). The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance, is not done in response to a delusion or hal­lucination (Criterion D), and is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion E). The objects are stolen despite the fact that they are typically of little value to the individual, who could have afforded to pay for them and often gives them away or discards them. Occasionally the individual may hoard the stolen objects or surreptitiously return them. Although individuals with this disorder will generally avoid stealing when immediate arrest is probable (e.g., in full view of a police officer), they usually do not preplan the thefts or fully take into account the chances of apprehension. The stealing is done without assistance from, or collaboration with, others.",
"103","and Conduct Disorder","Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of behavioral and physical symptoms, which can include withdrawal, tolerance, and craving. Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by withdrawal symptoms that develop approximately 4-12 hours after the reduction of in­take following prolonged, heavy alcohol ingestion. Because withdrawal from alcohol can be unpleasant and intense, individuals may continue to consume alcohol despite adverse consequences, often to avoid or to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Some withdrawal symp­toms (e.g., sleep problems) can persist at lower intensities for months and can contribute to relapse. Once a pattern of repetitive and intense use develops, individuals with alcohol use disorder may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and consuming alcoholic beverages.Craving for alcohol is indicated by a strong desire to drink that makes it difficult to think of anything else and that often results in the onset of drinking. School and job per­formance may also suffer either from the aftereffects of drinking or from actual intoxica­tion at school or on the job; child care or household responsibilities may be neglected; and alcohol-related absences may occur from school or work. The individual may use alcohol in physically hazardous circumstances (e.g., driving an automobile, swimming, operating machinery while intoxicated). Finally, individuals with an alcohol use disorder may con­tinue to consume alcohol despite the knowledge that continued consumption poses sig­nificant physical (e.g., blackouts, liver disease), psychological (e.g., depression), social, or interpersonal problems (e.g., violent arguments with spouse while intoxicated, child abuse).",
"104","and Conduct Disorder","",
"105","Alcohol Intoxication","The essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the presence of clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment, impaired social or occupational functioning) that develop during, or shortly after, alcohol ingestion (Criterion B). These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired functioning and judgment and, if intoxication is intense, can result in a life-threaten­ing coma. The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis), are not a reflection of conditions such as delirium, and are not related to intoxi­cation with other depressant drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) (Criterion D). The levels of incoor­dination can interfere with driving abilities and performance of usual activities to the point of causing accidents. Evidence of alcohol use can be obtained by smelling alcohol on the individ­ual's breath, eliciting a history from the individual or another observer, and, when needed, having the individual provide breath, blood, or urine samples for toxicology analyses.",
"106","Alcohol Withdrawal","The essential feature of alcohol withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops within several hours to a few days after the cessation of (or re­duction in) heavy and prolonged alcohol use (Criteria A and B). The withdrawal syn­drome includes two or more of the symptoms reflecting autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety listed in Criterion B, along with gastrointestinal symptoms.Withdrawal symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc­cupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another men­tal disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder), including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance (e.g., sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) (Criterion D).Symptoms can be relieved by administering alcohol or benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam). The withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood concentrations of alcohol decline sharply (i.e., within 4-12 hours) after alcohol use has been stopped or reduced. Reflecting the relatively fast metabolism of alcohol, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal usually peak in inten­sity during the second day of abstinence and are likely to improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day. Following acute withdrawal, however, symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and auto­nomic dysfunction may persist for up to 3-6 months at lower levels of intensity.Fewer than 10% of individuals who develop alcohol withdrawal will ever develop dra­matic symptoms (e.g., severe autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, alcohol withdrawal delir­ium). Tonic-clonic seizures occur in fewer than 3% of individuals.",
"107","Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder","Caffeine can be consumed from a number of different sources, including coffee, tea, caf- feinated soda, ""energy"" drinks, over-the-counter analgesics and cold remedies, energy aids (e.g., drinks), weight-loss aids, and chocolate. Caffeine is also increasingly being used as an additive to vitamins and to food products. More than 85% of children and adults con­sume caffeine regularly. Some caffeine users display symptoms consistent with problem­atic use, including tolerance and withdrawal (see ""Caffeine Withdrawal"" later in this chapter); the data are not available at this time to determine the clinical significance of a caffeine use disorder and its prevalence. In contrast, there is evidence that caffeine with­drawal and caffeine intoxication are clinically significant and sufficiently prevalent.The essential feature of caffeine intoxication is recent consumption of caffeine and five or more signs or symptoms that develop during or shortly after caffeine use (Criteria A and B). Symptoms include restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, and gastrointestinal complaints, which can occur with low doses (e.g., 200 mg) in vulnerable individuals such as children, the elderly, or individuals who have not been ex­posed to caffeine previously. Symptoms that generally appear at levels of more than 1 g/ day include muscle twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or car­diac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation. Caffeine intoxi­cation may not occur despite high caffeine intake because of the development of tolerance. The signs or symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The signs or symp­toms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., an anxiety disorder) or intoxication with another substance (Criterion D).",
"108","Caffeine Withdrawal","The essential feature of caffeine withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the abrupt cessation of (or substantial reduction in) pro­longed daily caffeine ingestion (Criterion B). The caffeine withdrawal syndrome is indi­cated by three or more of the following (Criterion B): headache; marked fatigue or drowsiness; dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability; difficulty concentrating; and flu-hke symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness). The withdrawal syn­drome causes clinical significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be associated with the physiological effects of another medical condition and are not better explained by an­other mental disorder (Criterion D).Headache is the hallmark feature of caffeine withdrawal and may be diffuse, gradual in development, throbbing, severe, and sensitive to movement. However, other symptoms of caffeine withdrawal can occur in the absence of headache. Caffeine is the most widely used behaviorally active drug in the world and is present in many different types of bev­erages (e.g., coffee, tea, maté, soft drinks, energy drinks), foods, energy aids, medications, and dietary supplements. Because caffeine ingestion is often integrated into social customs and daily rituals (e.g., coffee break, tea time), some caffeine consumers may be unaware of their physical dependence on caffeine. Thus, caffeine withdrawal symptoms could be un­expected and misattributed to other causes (e.g., the flu, migraine). Furthermore, caffeine withdrawal symptoms may occur when individuals are required to abstain from foods and beverages prior to medical procedures or when a usual caffeine dose is missed be­cause of a change in routine (e.g., during travel, weekends).The probability and severity of caffeine withdrawal generally increase as a function of usual daily caffeine dose. However, there is large variability among individuals and within individuals across different episodes in the incidence, severity, and time course of withdrawal symptoms. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms may occur after abrupt cessation of relatively low chronic daily doses of caffeine (i.e., 100 mg).",
"109","Cannabis Use Disorder","Cannabis use disorder and the other cannabis-related disorders include problems that are associated with substances derived from the cannabis plant and chemically similar syn­thetic compounds. Over time, this plant material has accumulated many names (e.g., weed, pot, herb, grass, reefer, mary jane, dagga, dope, bhang, skunk, boom, gangster, kif, and ganja). A concentrated extraction of the cannabis plant that is also commonly used is hashish. Cannabis is the generic and perhaps the most appropriate scientific term for the psychoactive substance(s) derived from the plant, and as such it is used in this manual to refer to all forms of cannabis-like substances, including synthetic cannabinoid com­pounds.Synthetic oral formulations (pill/capsules) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9- THC) are availal l̂e by prescription for a number of approved medical indications (e.g., for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy; for anorexia and weight loss in individuals with AIDS). Other synthetic cannabinoid compounds have been manufactured and dis­tributed for nonmedical use in the form of plant material that has been sprayed with a can­nabinoid formulation (e.g., K2, Spice, JWH-018, JWH-073).The cannabinoids have diverse effects in the brain, prominent among which are actions on CBl and CB2 cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the central nervous sys­tem. Endogenous ligands for these receptors behave essentially like neurotransmitters. The potency of cannabis (delta-9-THC concentration) that is generally available varies greatly, ranging from 1% to approximately 15% in typical cannabis plant material and 10%-20% in hashish. During the past two decades, a steady increase in the potency of seized cannabis has been observed.Cannabis is most commonly smoked via a variety of methods: pipes, water pipes (bongs or hookahs), cigarettes (joints or reefers), or, most recently, in the paper from hol­lowed out cigars (blunts). Cannabis is also sometimes ingested orally, typically by mixing it into food. More recently, devices have been developed in which cannabis is ""vapor­ized."" Vaporization involves heating the plant material to release psychoactive cannabi­noids for inhalation. As with other psychoactive substances, smoking (and vaporization) typically produces more rapid onset and more intense experiences of the desired effects.Individuals who regularly use cannabis can develop all the general diagnostic features of a substance use disorder. Cannabis use disorder is commonly observed as the only sub­stance use disorder experienced by the individual; however, it also frequently occurs con­currently with other types of substance use disorders (i.e., alcohol, cocaine, opioid). In cases for which multiple types of substances are used, many times the individual may minimize the symptoms related to cannabis, as the symptoms may be less severe or cause less harm than those directly related to the use of the other substances. Pharmacological and behavioral tolerance to most of the effects of cannabis has been reported in individuals who use cannabis persistently. Generally, tolerance is lost when cannabis use is discontin­ued for a significant period of time (i.e., for at least several months).New to DSM-5 is the recognition that abrupt cessation of daily or near-daily cannabis use often results in the onset of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Common symptoms of withdrawal include irritability, anger or aggression, anxiety, depressed mood, restless­ness, sleep difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss. Although typically not as severe as alcohol or opiate withdrawal, the cannabis withdrawal syndrome can cause sig­nificant distress and contribute to difficulty quitting or relapse among those trying to abstain.Individuals with cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the day over a period of months or years, and thus may spend many hours a day under the influence. Others may use less frequently, but their use causes recurrent problems related to family, school, work, or other important activities (e.g., repeated absences at work; neglect of fam­ily obligations). Periodic cannabis use and intoxication can negatively affect behavioral and cognitive functioning and thus interfere with optimal performance at work or school, or place the individual at increased physical risk when performing activities that could be physically hazardous (e.g., driving a car; playing certain sports; performing manual work activities, including operating machinery). Arguments with spouses or parents over the use of cannabis in the home, or its use in the presence of children, can adversely impact family functioning and are common features of those with cannabis use disorder. Last, in­dividuals with cannabis use disorder may continue using despite knowledge of physical problems (e.g., chronic cough related to smoking) or psychological problems (e.g., exces­sive sedation or exacerbation of other mental health problems) associated with its use.Whether or not cannabis is being used for legitimate medical reasons may also affect diagnosis. When a substance is taken as indicated for a medical condition, symptoms oftolerance and withdrawal will naturally occur and should not be used as the primary cri­teria for determining a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. Although medical uses of cannabis remain controversial and equivocal, use for medical circumstances should be considered when a diagnosis is being made.",
"110","Cannabis Intoxication","The essential feature of cannabis intoxication is the presence of clinically significant prob­lematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop during, or shortly after, canna­bis use (Criterion B). Intoxication typically begins with a ''high"" feeling followed by symptoms that include euphoria with inappropriate laughter and grandiosity, sedation, lethargy, impairment in short-term memory, difficulty carrying out complex mental pro­cesses, impaired judgment, distorted sensory perceptions, impaired motor performance, and the sensation that time is passing slowly. Occasionally, anxiety (which can be severe),dysphoria, or social withdrawal occurs. These psychoactive effects are accompanied by two or more of the following signs, developing within 2 hours of cannabis use: conjuncti­val injection, increased appetite, dry mouth, and tachycardia (Criterion C).Intoxication develops within minutes if the cannabis is smoked but may take a few hours to develop if the cannabis is ingested orally. The effects usually last 3-4 hours, with the duration being somewhat longer when the substance is ingested orally. The magnitude of the behavioral and physiological changes depends on the dose, the method of adminis­tration, and the characteristics of the individual using the substance, such as rate of absorp­tion, tolerance, and sensitivity to the effects of the substance. Because most cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), are fat soluble, the effects of canna­bis or hashish may occasionally persist or reoccur for 12-24 hours because of the slow re­lease of psychoactive substances from fatty tissue or to enterohepatic circulation.",
"111","Cannabis Withdrawal","The essential feature of cannabis withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the cessation of or substantial reduction in heavy and pro­longed cannabis use. In addition to the symptoms in Criterion B, the following may also be observed postabstinence: fatigue, yawning, difficulty concentrating, and rebound periods of increased appetite and hypersomnia that follow initial periods of loss of appetite and in­somnia. For the diagnosis, withdrawal symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). Many cannabis users report smoking cannabis or taking other substances to help re­lieve withdrawal symptoms, and many report that withdrawal symptoms make quitting difficult or have contributed to relapse. The symptoms typically are not of sufficient se­verity to require medical attention, but medication or behavioral strategies may help alle­viate symptoms and improve prognosis in those trying to quit using cannabis.Cannabis withdrawal is commonly observed in individuals seeking treatment for can­nabis use as well as in heavy cannabis users who are not seeking treatment. Among indi­viduals who have used cannabis regularly during some period of their lifetime, up to one- third report having experienced cannabis withdrawal. Among adults and adolescents en­rolled in treatment or heavy cannabis users, 50%-95% report cannabis withdrawal. These findings indicate that cannabis withdrawal occurs among a substantial subset of regular cannabis users who try to quit.Development and CourseThe amount, duration, and frequency of cannabis smoking that is required to produce an associated withdrawal disorder during a quit attempt are unknown. Most symptoms have their onset within the first 24-72 hours of cessation, peak within the first week, and last approximately 1-2 weeks. Sleep difficulties may last more than 30 days. Cannabis with­drawal has been documented among adolescents and adults. Withdrawal tends to be more common and severe among adults, most likely related to the more persistent and greater frequency and quantity of use among adults.Risk and Prognostic Factors\Environmental. Most likely, the prevalence and severity of cannabis withdrawal are greater among heavier cannabis users, and particularly among those seeking treatment for cannabis use disorders. Withdrawal severity also appears to be positively related to the se­verity of comorbid symptoms of mental disorders.Functional Consequences of Cannabis WithdrawalCannabis users report using cannabis to relieve withdrawal symptoms, suggesting that withdrawal might contribute to ongoing expression of cannabis use disorder. Worse out­comes may be associated with greater withdrawal. A substantial proportion of adults and adolescents in treatment for moderate to severe cannabis use disorder acknowledge mod­erate to severe withdrawal symptoms, and many complain that these symptoms make ces­sation more difficult. Cannabis users report having relapsed to cannabis use or initiating use of other drugs (e.g., tranquilizers) to provide relief from cannabis withdrawal symp­toms. Last, individuals living with cannabis users observe significant withdrawal effects, suggesting that such symptoms are disruptive to daily living.Differential DiagnosisBecause many of the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are also symptoms of other sub­stance withdrawal syndromes or of depressive or bipolar disorders, careful evaluation should focus on ensuring that the symptoms are not better explained by cessation from an­other substance (e.g., tobacco or alcohol withdrawal), another mental disorder (general­ized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), or another medical condition.Other Cannabis-Induced DisordersThe following cannabis-induced disorders are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (""Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders""); cannabis-induced anxiety disorder (''Anxiety Disorders""); and cannabis-induced sleep disorder (""Sleep-Wake Disorders""). For cannabis intoxication delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter ""Neurocog- nitive Disorders."" These cannabis-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of cannabis in­toxication or cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder292.9 (F12.99)This category applies to presentations in whicii symptoms characteristic of a cannabis- related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa­tional, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific cannabis-related disorder or any of the disorders in the substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.Hallucinogen-Related DisordersPhencyclidine Use Disorder Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder Phencyclidine Intoxication Other Hallucinogen Intoxication Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder Other Phencyclidine-induced Disorders Other Hallucinogen-induced Disorders Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related DisorderPhencyclidine Use DisorderDiagnostic CriteriaA. A pattern of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance) use leading toclinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the follow­ing, occurring within a 12-month period:1. Phencyclidine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was in­tended.2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control phency­clidine use.3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain phencyclidine, use the phencyclidine, or recover from its effects.4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use phencyclidine.5. Recurrent phencyclidine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work performance related to phencyclidine use; phencyclidine-related absences, suspensions, or ex­pulsions from school; neglect of children or household).6. Continued phencyclidine use despite having persistent or recurrent social or inter­personal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the phencyclidine (e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication; physical fights).7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced be­cause of phencyclidine use.8. Recurrent phencyclidine use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by a phencyclidine).9. Phencyclidine use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recur­rent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exac­erbated by the phencyclidine.10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the phencyclidine to achieve intoxi­cation or desired effect.b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the phencyclidine.Note: Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established for phencyclidines, and so this criterion does not apply. (Withdrawal from phencyclidines has been reported in animals but not documented in human users.)Specify if:In early remission: After full criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).In sustained remission: After full criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were previ­ously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine,” may be met).Specify if:In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to phencyclidines is restricted.Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a phencyclidine intoxica­tion or another phencyclidine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for phencyclidine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is in­dicated in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific phencyclidine-induced mental disorder). For ex­ample, if there is comorbid phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, only the phencyclidine- induced psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the co­morbid phencyclidine use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild phencycli­dine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder.Specify current severity:305.90 (F I6.10) Mild: Presence of 2-3 symptoms.304.60 (F I 6.20) Moderate: Presence of 4-5 symptoms.304.60 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.Specifiers""In a controlled environment"" applies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.Diagnostic FeaturesThe phencyclidines (or phencyclidine-like substances) include phencyclidine (e.g., PCP, ""angel dust"") and less potent but similarly acting compounds such as ketamine, cyclohex- amine, and dizocilpine. These substances were first developed as dissociative anesthetics in the 1950s and became street drugs in the 1960s. They produce feelings of separation from mind and body (hence ""dissociative"") in low doses, and at high doses, stupor and coma can result. These substances are most commonly smoked or taken orally, but they may also be snorted or injected. Although the primary psychoactive effects of PCP last for a few hours, the total elimination rate of this drug from the body typically extends 8 days or longer. The hallucinogenic effects in vulnerable individuals may last for weeks and may precipitate a persistent psychotic episode resembling schizophrenia. Ketamine has been observed to have utility in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Withdrawal symp­toms have not been clearly established in humans, and therefore the withdraw^al criterion is not included in the diagnosis of phencyclidine use disorder.",
"112","Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder","Hallucinogens comprise a diverse group of substances that, despite having different chem­ical structures and possibly involving different molecular mechanisms, produce similar alterations of perception, mood, and cognition in users. Hallucinogens included are phenyl­alkylamines (e.g., mescaline, DOM [2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine], and MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; also called ""ecstasy""]); the indoleamines, includ­ing psilocybin (i.e., psilocin) and dimethyltryptamine (DMT); and the ergolines, such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and morning glory seeds. In addition, miscellaneous other ethnobotanical compounds are classified as ""hallucinogens,"" of which Salvia divinorum and jimsonweed are two examples. Excluded from the hallucinogen group are cannabis and its active compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (see the section ""Cannabis-Related Disorders""). These substances can have hallucinogenic effects but are diagnosed separately because of significant differences in their psychological and behavioral effects.Hallucinogens are usually taken orally, although some forms are smoked (e.g., DMT, salvia) or (rarely) taken intranasally or by injection (e.g., ecstasy). Duration of effects variesacross types of hallucinogens. Some of these substances (i.e., LSD, MDMA) have a long half-life and extended duration such that users may spend hours to days using and/or re­covering from the effects of these drugs. However, other hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., DMT, salvia) are short acting. Tolerance to hallucinogens develops with repeated use and has been reported to have both autonomic and psychological effects. Cross-tolerance exists be­tween LSD and other hallucinogens (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline) but does not extend to other drug categories such as amphetamines and cannabis.MDMA/ecstasy as a hallucinogen may have distinctive effects attributable to both its hal­lucinogenic and its stimulant properties. Among heavy ecstasy users, continued use despite physical or psychological problems, tolerance, hazardous use, and spending a great deal of time obtaining the substance are the most commonly reported criteria—over 50% in adults and over 30% in a younger sample, while legal problems related to substance use and persis­tent desire/inability to quit are rarely reported. As found for other substances, diagnostic cri­teria for other hallucinogen use disorder are arrayed along a single continuum of severity.One of the generic criteria for substance use disorders, a clinically significant with­drawal syndrome, has not been consistently documented in humans, and therefore the di­agnosis of hallucinogen withdrawal syndrome is not included in DSM-5. However, there is evidence of withdrawal from MDMA, with endorsement of two or more withdrawal symptoms observed in 59%-98% in selected samples of ecstasy users. Both psychological and physical problems have been commonly reported as withdrawal problems.",
"113","Phencyclidine Intoxication","Phencyclidine intoxication reflects the clinically significant behavioral changes that occur shortly after ingestion of this substance (or a pharmacologically similar substance). The most common clinical presentations of phencyclidine intoxication include disorientation, confusion without hallucinations, hallucinations or delusions, a catatonic-like syndrome, and coma of varying severity. The intoxication typically lasts for several hours but, de­pending on the type of clinical presentation and whether other drugs besides phencycli­dine were consumed, may last for several days or longer.",
"114","Other Hallucinogen Intoxication","Other hallucinogen intoxication reflects the clinically significant behavioral or psycholog­ical changes that occur shortly after ingestion of a hallucinogen. Depending on the specific hallucinogen, the intoxication may last only minutes (e.g., for salvia) or several hours or longer (e.g., for LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] or MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxymetham­phetamine]).",
"115","Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder","The hallmark of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder is the reexperiencing, when the individual is sober, of the perceptual disturbances that were experienced while the individ­ual was intoxicated with the hallucinogen (Criterion A). The symptoms may include any perceptual perturbations, but visual disturbances tend to be predominant. Typical of the ab­normal visual perceptions are geometric hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in the peripheral visual fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving ob­jects (i.e., images left suspended in the path of a moving object as seen in stroboscopic pho­tography), perceptions of entire objects, positive afterimages (i.e., a same-colored or complementary-colored ""shadow"" of an object remaining after removal of the object), halos around objects, or misperception of images as too large (macropsia) or too small (micropsia). Duration of the visual disturbances may be episodic or nearly continuous and must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B). The disturbances may last for weeks, months, or years. Other explanations for the disturbances (e.g., brain lesions, preexisting psychosis, seizure disor­ders, migraine aura without headaches) must be ruled out (Criterion C).Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder occurs primarily after LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) use, but not exclusively. There does not appear to be a strong correlation be­tween hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and number of occasions of hallucino­gen use, with some instances of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder occurring in individuals with minimal exposure to hallucinogens. Some instances of hallucinogen per­sisting perception disorder may be triggered by use of other substances (e.g., cannabis or alcohol) or in adaptation to dark environments.",
"116","Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder","Features of inhalant use disorder include repeated use of an inhalant substance despite the individual's knowing that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual (Criterion A9). Those problems are reflected in the diagnostic criteria.Missing work or school or inability to perform t)^ical responsibilities at work or school (Criterion A5), and continued use of the inhalant substance even though it causes arguments with family or friends, fights, and other social or interpersonal problems (Criterion A6), may be seen in inhalant use disorder. Limiting family contact, work or school obligations, or rec­reational activities (e.g., sports, games, hobbies) may also occur (Criterion A7). Use of inhal­ants when driving or operating dangerous equipment (Criterion A8) is also seen.Tolerance (Criterion AlO) and mild withdrawal are each reported by about 10% of in­dividuals who use inhalants, and a few individuals use inhalants to avoid withdrawal. However, because the withdrawal symptoms are mild, this manual neither recognizes a diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal nor counts withdrawal complaints as a diagnostic crite­rion for inhalant use disorder.",
"117","Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder","",
"118","Inhalant Intoxication","Inhalant intoxication is an inhalant-related, clinically significant mental disorder that de­velops during, or immediately after, intended or unintended inhalation of a volatile hy­drocarbon substance. Volatile hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and other volatile compounds. When it is possible to do so, the particular substance involved should be named (e.g., toluene intoxication). Among those who do, the intoxication clears within a few minutes to a few hours after the exposure ends. Thus, inhalant intoxication usually occurs in brief episodes that may recur.",
"119","Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder","Opioid use disorder includes signs and symptoms that reflect compulsive, prolonged self­administration of opioid substances that are used for no legitimate medical purpose or, if another medical condition is present that requires opioid treatment, that are used in doses greatly in excess of the amount needed for that medical condition. (For example, an indi­vidual prescribed analgesic opioids for pain relief at adequate dosing will use significantly more than prescribed and not only because of persistent pain.) Individuals with opioid use disorder tend to develop such regular patterns of compulsive drug use that daily activities are planned around obtaining and administering opioids. Opioids are usually purchased on the illegal market but may also be obtained from physicians by falsifying or exagger­ating general medical problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions from several physicians. Health care professionals with opioid use disorder will often obtain opioids by writing prescriptions for themselves or by diverting opioids that have been prescribed for patients or from pharmacy supplies. Most individuals with opioid use disorder have significant levels of tolerance and will experience withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation of opioid substances. Individuals with opioid use disorder often develop conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing any heroin powder-like sub­stance)—a phenomenon that occurs with most drugs that cause intense psychological changes. These responses probably contribute to relapse, are difficult to extinguish, and typ­ically persist long after detoxification is completed.",
"120","Opioid Intoxication","The essential feature of opioid intoxication is the presence of clinically significant prob­lematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment) that develop dur­ing, or shortly after, opioid use (Criteria A and B). Intoxication is accompanied by pupil­lary constriction (unless there has been a severe overdose with consequent anoxia and pupillary dilation) and one or more of the following signs: drowsiness (described as be­ing ""on the nod""), slurred speech, and impairment in attention or memory (Criterion C); drowsiness may progress to coma. Individuals with opioid intoxication may demonstrate inattention to the environment, even to the point of ignoring potentially harmful events. The signs or symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D).Differential DiagnosisOther substance intoxication. Alcohol intoxication and sedative-hypnotic intoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or sedative-hypnotic intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of pupillary con­striction or the lack of a response to a naloxone challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone chal­lenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects.Other opioid-related disorders. Opioid intoxication is distinguished from the other opioid-induced disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with onset during in­toxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate in the clinical pre­sentation and meet full criteria for the relevant disorder.Opioid WithdrawalDiagnostic Criteria 292.0 (F11.23)A. Presence of either of the following;1. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e., several weeks or longer).2. Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use.B. Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to several days after Criterion A:1. Dysphoric mood.2. Nausea or vomiting.3. Muscle aches.4. Lacrimation or rhinorrhea.5. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating.6. Diarrhea.7. Yawning.8. Fever.9. Insomnia.C. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for opioid withdrawal is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder, reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not permissible to code a co­morbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid withdrawal.Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of opioid withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged (Criterion Al). The withdrawal syndrome can also be precipitated by administration of an opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone or naltrexone) after a period of opioid use (Criterion A2). This may also occur after administration of an opioid partial ag­onist such as buprenorphine to a person currently using a full opioid agonist.Opioid withdrawal is characterized by a pattern of signs and symptoms that are oppo­site to the acute agonist effects. The first of these are subjective and consist of complaints of anxiety, restlessness, and an ""achy feeling"" that is often located in the back and legs, along with irritability and increased sensitivity to pain. Three or more of the following must be present to make a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal: dysphoric mood; nausea or vomiting; muscle aches; lacrimation or rhinorrhea; pupillary dilation, piloerection, or increased sweating; diarrhea; yawning; fever; and insonmia (Criterion B). Piloerection and fever are associated with more severe withdrawal and are not often seen in routine clinical practice because individuals with opioid use disorder usually obtain substances before with­drawal becomes that far advanced. These symptoms of opioid withdrawal must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar­eas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another med­ical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). Meeting diagnostic criteria for opioid withdrawal alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, but concurrent symptoms of craving and drug-seeking behavior are suggestive of comorbid opioid use disorder. ICD-IO-CM codes only allow a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal in the presence of comorbid moderate to severe opioid use disorder.The speed and severity of withdrawal associated with opioids depend on the half-life of the opioid used. Most individuals who are physiologically dependent on short-acting drugs such as heroin begin to have withdrawal symptoms within 6-12 hours after the last dose. Symptoms may take 2-4 days to emerge in the case of longer-acting drugs such as metha­done, LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol), or buprenorphine. Acute withdrawal symptoms for a short-acting opioid such as heroin usually peak within 1-3 days and gradually subside over a period of 5-7 days. Less acute withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks to months. These more chronic symptoms include anxiety, dysphoria, anhedonia, and insomnia.",
"121","Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder","Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine­like drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon), carbamates (e.g., glutethimide, meprobamate), barbiturates (e.g., secobarbital), and barbiturate-like hypnotics (e.g., glutethimide, meth- aqualone). This class of substances includes all prescription sleeping medications and almost all prescription antianxiety medications. Nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety agents (e.g., buspirone, gepirone) are not included in this class because they do not appear to be associated with significant misuse.Like alcohol, these agents are brain depressants and can produce similar substance/ medication-induced and substance use disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic sub­stances are available both by prescription and illegally. Some individuals who obtain these substances by prescription will develop a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, while others who misuse these substances or use them for intoxication will not develop a use disorder. In particular, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with rapid onset and/or short to intermediate lengths of action may be taken for intoxication purposes, although longer acting substances in this class may be taken for intoxication as well.Craving (Criterion A4), either while using or during a period of abstinence, is a typical feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Misuse of substances from this class may occur on its own or in conjunction with use of other substances. For example, in­dividuals may use intoxicating doses of sedatives or benzodiazepines to ""come down"" from cocaine or amphetamines or use high doses of benzodiazepines in combination with methadone to ""boost"" its effects.Repeated absences or poor work performance, school absences, suspensions or expul­sions, and neglect of children or household (Criterion A5) may be related to sedative, hyp­notic, or anxiolytic use disorder, as may the continued use of the substances despite arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication or despite physical fights (Criterion A6). Limiting contact with family or friends, avoiding work or school, or stop­ping participation in hobbies, sports, or games (Criterion A7) and recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use when driving an automobile or operating a machine when im­paired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use (Criterion A8) are also seen in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.Very significant levels of tolerance and withdrawal can develop to the sedative, hyp­notic, or anxiolytic. There may be evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of a diagnosis of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder in an individual who has abruptly discontinued use of benzodiazepines that were taken for long periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses. In these cases, an additional diagnosis of sedative, hyp­notic, or anxiolytic use disorder is made only if other criteria are met. That is, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications may be prescribed for appropriate medical purposes, and depending on the dose regimen, these drugs may then produce tolerance and with­drawal. If these drugs are prescribed or recommended for appropriate medical purposes, and if they are uöed as prescribed, the resulting tolerance or withdrawal does not meet the criteria for diagnosing a substance use disorder. However, it is necessary to determine whether the drugs were appropriately prescribed and used (e.g., falsifying medical symp­toms to obtain the medication; using more medication than prescribed; obtaining the med­ication from several doctors without informing them of the others' involvement).Given the unidimensional nature of the symptoms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severity is based on the number of criteria endorsed.",
"122","Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication","The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is the presence of clini­cally significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment, impaired social or occupational functioning) that develop during, or shortly after, use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic (Criteria A and B). As with other brain depressants, such as alcohol, these behaviors may be ac­companied by slurred speech, incoordination (at levels that can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual activities to the point of causing falls or automobile accidents), an unsteady gait, nystagmus, impairment in cognition (e.g., attentional or memory problems), and stupor or coma (Criterion C). Memory impairment is a prominent feature of sedative, hyp­notic, or anxiolytic intoxication and is most often characterized by an anterograde amnesia tiiat resembles ""alcoholic blackouts,"" which can be disturbing to the individual. The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by anothermental disorder (Criterion D). Intoxication may occur in individuals who are receiving these substances by prescription, are borrov îng the medication from friends or relatives, or are de­liberately taking the substance to achieve intoxication.",
"123","Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal","The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is the presence of a char­acteristic syndrome that develops after a marked decrease in or cessation of intake after several weeks or more of regular use (Criteria A and B). This withdrawal syndrome is characterized by two or more symptoms (similar to alcohol withdrawal) that include autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, or body temperature, along with sweating); a tremor of the hands; insomnia; nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting; anxiety; and psychomotor agitation. A grand mal seizure may occur in perhaps as many as 20%-30% of individuals undergoing untreated withdrawal from these substances. In severe withdrawal, visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions can occur but are usually in the context of a delirium. If the individual's reality testing is intact (i.e., he or she knows the substance is causing the hallucinations) and the illusions occur in a clear sensorium, the spec­ifier 'Vith perceptual disturbances"" can be noted. When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality testing, a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc­cupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental dis­order (e.g., alcohol withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder) (Criterion D). Relief of with­drawal symptoms with administration of any sedative-hypnotic agent would support a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.",
"124","or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder","The amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimulants include substances with a substi- tuted-phenylethylamine structure, such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and meth- amphetamine. Also included are those substances that are structurally different but have similar effects, such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken orally or in­travenously, although methamphetamine is also taken by the nasal route. In addition to the synthetic amphetamine-type compounds, there are naturally occurring, plant-derived stimulants such as khât. Amphetamines and other stimulants may be obtained by prescrip­tion for the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcolepsy. Consequently, prescribed stimulants may be diverted into the illegal market. The effects of amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are similar to those of cocaine, such that the criteria for stimulant use disorder are presented here as a single disorder with the ability to specify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be consumed in sev­eral preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine hydrochloride, and cocaine alka­loids such as freebase and crack) that differ in potency because of varying levels of purity and speed of onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active ingredient. Cocaine hydrochloride powder is usually ""snorted"" through the nostrils or dissolved in water and injected intravenously.Individuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can develop stimu­lant use disorder as rapidly as 1 week, although the onset is not always this rapid. Re­gardless of the route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and can enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have experienced tol­erance or withdrawal.Use patterns and course are similar for disorders involving amphetamine-type stimu­lants and cocaine, as both substances are potent central nervous system stimulants with similar psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are longer acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day. Usage may be chronic or episodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior is common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense temporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as paranoid ideation and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high­dose use.Withdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that can resemble a major depressive episode; the depressive symptoms usually resolve within 1 week. Tolerance to amphetamine-type stimulants develops and leads to escalation of the dose. Conversely, some users of amphetamine-type stimulants develop sensitization, characterized by enhanced effects.",
"125","Stimulant Intoxication","The essential feature of stimulant intoxication, related to amphetamine-type stimulants and cocaine, is the presence of clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes that develop during, or shortly after, use of stimulants (Criteria A and B). Auditory hallu­cinations may be prominent, as may paranoid ideation, and these symptoms must be dis­tinguished from an independent psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Stimulant intoxication usually begins with a ""high"" feeling and includes one or more of the follow­ing: euphoria with enhanced vigor, gregariousness, hyperactivity, restlessness, hypervig­ilance, interpersonal sensitivity, talkativeness, anxiety, tension, alertness, grandiosity, stereotyped and repetitive behavior, anger, impaired judgment, and, in the case of chronic intoxication, affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and social withdrawal. These be­havioral and psychological changes are accompanied by two or more of the following signs and symptoms that develop during or shortly after stimulant use: tachycardia or bra­dycardia; pupillary dilation; elevated or lowered blood pressure; perspiration or chills; nausea or vomiting; evidence of weight loss; psychomotor agitation or retardation; mus­cular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias; and confu­sion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma (Criterion C). Intoxication, either acute or chronic, is often associated with impaired social or occupational functioning. Severe in­toxication can lead to convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death. For the diagnosis of stimulant intoxication to be made, the symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and not better explained by another mental disorder (Crite­rion D). While stimulant intoxication occurs in individuals with stimulant use disorders, in­toxication is not a criterion for stimulant use disorder, which is confirmed by the presence of two of the 11 diagnostic criteria for use disorder.",
"126","Stimulant Withdrawal","The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic with­drawal syndrome that develops within a few hours to several days after the cessation of (or marked reduction in) stimulant use (generally high dose) that has been prolonged (Cri­terion A). The withdrawal syndrome is characterized by the development of dysphoric mood accompanied by two or more of the following physiological changes: fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor retardation or agitation (Criterion B). Bradycardia is often present and is a reliable mea­sure of stimulant withdrawal.Anhedonia and drug craving can often be present but are not part of the diagnostic cri­teria. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu­pational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D).",
"127","Tobacco Use Disorder","Tobacco use disorder is common among individuals who use cigarettes and smokeless to­bacco daily and is uncommon among individuals who do not use tobacco daily or who use nicotine medications. Tolerance to tobacco is exemplified by the disappearance of nausea and dizziness after repeated intake and with a more intense effect of tobacco the first time it is used during the day. Cessation of tobacco use can produce a well-defined withdrawal syndrome. Many individuals with tobacco use disorder use tobacco to relieve or to avoid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., after being in a situation where use is restricted). Many indi­viduals who use tobacco have tobacco-related physical symptoms or diseases and con­tinue to smoke. The large majority report craving when they do not smoke for several hours. Spending excessive time using tobacco can be exemplified by chain-smoking (i.e., smok­ing one cigarette after another with no time between cigarettes). Because tobacco sources are readily and legally available, and because nicotine intoxication is very rare, spending a great deal of time attempting to procure tobacco or recovering from its effects is uncom­mon. Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities can occur when an individual forgoes an activity because it occurs in tobacco use-restricted areas. Use of tobacco rarely results in failure to fulfill major role obligations (e.g., interference with work, interference with home obligations), but persistent social or inteφersonal problems (e.g., having arguments with others about tobacco use, avoiding social situations because of others' disapproval of tobacco use) or use that is physically hazardous (e.g., smoking inbed, smoking around flammable chemicals) occur at an intermediate prevalence. Although these criteria are less often endorsed by tobacco users, if endorsed, they can indicate a more severe disorder.",
"128","Tobacco Withdrawal","Withdrawal symptoms impair the ability to stop tobacco use. The symptoms after absti­nence from tobacco are in large part due to nicotine deprivation. Symptoms are much more intense among individuals who smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco than among those who use nicotine medications. This difference in symptom intensity is likely due to the more rapid onset and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking. Tobacco withdrawal is common among daily tobacco users who stop or reduce but can also occur among nondaily users. Typically, heart rate decreases by 5-12 beats per minute in the first few days after stopping smoking, and weight increases an average of 4-7 lb (2-3 kg) over the first year after stopping smoking. Tobacco withdrawal can produce clinically signifi­cant mood changes and functional impairment.",
"129","Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder","The diagnostic dass other (or unknown) substance use and related disorders comprises substance-related disorders unrelated to alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (phen­cyclidine and others); inhalants; opioids; sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including amphetamine and cocaine); or tobacco. Such substances include anabolic ste­roids; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cortisol; antiparkinsonian medications; an­tihistamines; nitrous oxide; amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrites; betel nut, which is chewed in many cultures to produce mild euphoria and a floating sensation; kava (from a South Pacific pepper plant), which produces sedation, incoordination, weight loss, mild hepati­tis, and lung abnormalities; or cathinones (including khât plant agents and synthetic chem­ical derivatives) that produce stimulant effects. Unknown substance-related disorders are associated with unidentified substances, such as intoxications in which the individual can­not identify the ingested drug, or substance use disorders involving either new, black mar­ket drugs not yet identified or familiar drugs illegally sold under false names.Other (or unknown) substance use disorder is a mental disorder in which repeated use of an other or unknown substance typically continues, despite the individual's knowing that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual. Those problems are re­flected in the diagnostic criteria. When the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., nitrous oxide use disorder).",
"130","Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication","Other (or unknown) substance intoxication is a clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or immediately after, use of either a) a substance not elsewhere ad­dressed in this chapter (i.e., alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; phencyclidine and other halluci­nogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or b) an unknown substance. If the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding.Application of the diagnostic criteria for other (or unknown) substance intoxication is very challenging. Criterion A requires development of a reversible ""substance-specific syndrome,"" but if the substance is unknown, that syndrome usually will be unknown. To resolve this conflict, clinicians may ask the individual or obtain collateral history as to whether the individual has experienced a similar episode after using substances with the same ""street"" name or from the same source. Similarly, hospital emergency departments sometimes recognize over a few days numerous presentations of a severe, unfamiliar in­toxication syndrome from a newly available, previously unknown substance. Because of the great variety of intoxicating substances. Criterion B can provide only broad examples of signs and symptoms from some intoxications, with no threshold for the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis; clinical judgment guides those decisions. Criterion C requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, or intoxications.",
"131","Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal","Other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is a clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or within a few hours to days after, reducing or terminating dosing with a substance (Criteria A and B). Although recent dose reduction or termination usually is clear in the history, other diagnostic procedures are very challenging if the drug is un­known. Criterion B requires development of a ""substance-specific syndrome"" (i.e., the in­dividual's signs and symptoms must correspond with the known withdrawal syndrome for the recently stopped drug)—a requirement that rarely can be met with an unknown substance. Consequently, clinical judgment must guide such decisions when information is this limited. Criterion D requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, or withdrawals from familiar substances. When the substance is known, it should be re­flected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., betel nut withdrawal).PrevaienceThe prevalence of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is unknown.Deveiopment and CourseWithdrawal signs commonly appear some hours after use of the substance is terminated, but the onset and course vary greatly, depending on the dose typically used by the person and the rate of elimination of the specific substance from the body. At peak severity, with­drawal symptoms from some substances involve only moderate levels of discomfort, whereas withdrawal from other substances may be fatal. Withdrawal-associated dyspho­ria often motivates relapse to substance use. Withdrawal symptoms slowly abate over days, weeks, or months, depending on the particular drug and doses to which the indi­vidual became tolerant.Cuiture-Reiated Diagnostic issuesCulture-related issues in diagnosis will vary with the particular substance.Functional Consequences of Other (or Unknown) Substance WithdrawalWithdrawal from any substance may have serious consequences, including physical signs and symptoms (e.g., malaise, vital sign changes, abdominal distress, headache), intense drug craving, anxiety, depression, agitation, psychotic symptoms, or cognitive impairments. These consequences may lead to problems such as dysfunction at work, problems in in­terpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high­risk behavior (e.g., having unprotected sex), suicide attempts, and substance or medica­tion overdose. The pattern of consequences will vary with the particular substance.Differential DiagnosisDose reduction after extended dosing, but not meeting the criteria for other (or un­known) substance withdrawal. The individual used other (or unknown) substances, but the dose that was used was insufficient to produce symptoms that meet the criteria re­quired for the diagnosis.Substance withdrawal or other substance/medication-induced disorders. Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may expe­rience withdrawal when discontinuing those substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself may help to identify it.Different types of other (or unknown) substance-related disorders. Episodes of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal may occur during, but are distinct from, other (or un­known) substance use disorder, unspecified other (or unknown) substance-related disor­der, and unspecified other (or unknown) substance-induced disorders.Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that im­pair brain function and cognition. Numerous neurological and other medical condi­tions may produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of withdrawals. Paradoxically, drug intoxications also must be ruled out, because, for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another drug.ComorbidityAs with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct disorder, adult antisocial per­sonality disorder, and other substance use disorders likely co-occur with other (or un­known) substance withdrawal.Other (or Unknown) Substance-Induced DisordersBecause the category of other or unknown substances is inherently ill-defined, the extent and range of induced disorders are uncertain. Nevertheless, other (or unknown) sub­stance-induced disorders are possible and are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication- induced mental disorders in these chapters): other (or unknown) substance-induced psy­chotic disorder (""Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders""); other (or un­known substance-induced bipolar disorder (""Bipolar and Related Disorders""); other (or unknown) substance-induced depressive disorder (""Depressive Disorders""); other (or unknown) substance-induced anxiety disorders (""Anxiety Disorders""); other (or un­known) substance-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder (""Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders""); other (or unknown) substance-induced sleep disorder (""Sleep-WakeDisorders""); other (or unknown) substance-induced sexual dysfunction (""Sexual Dys­functions""); an(J other (or unknown) substance/medication-induced major or mild neu- rocognitive disorder (""Neurocognitive Disorders""). For other (or unknown) substance- induced intoxication delirium and other (or unknown) substance-induced withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter ""Neurocognitive Dis­orders."" These other (or unknown) substance-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of other (or unknown) substance intoxication or other (or unknown) substance withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.Unspecified Other (or Unknown) Substance-Related Disorder292.9 (F19.99)This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an other (or un­known) substance-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific other (or unknown) substance-related disorder or any of the disorders in the substance-related disorders diagnostic class.Non-Substance-Related DisordersGambling DisorderDiagnostic Criteria 312.31 (F63.0)A. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significantimpairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the fol­lowing in a 12-month period:1. Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement.2. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.3. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.4. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble).5. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed).6. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing” one’s losses).7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.8. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career op­portunity because of gambling.9. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling.B. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode.Specify if:Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, witli symptoms sub­siding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months.Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years.Specify if:in eariy remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months.in sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer.Specify current severity:Mild: 4-5 criteria met. iModerate: 6-7 criteria met.Severe: 8-9 criteria met.Note: Although some behavioral conditions that do not involve ingestion of substances have similarities to substance-related disorders, only one disorder—gambling disorder— has sufficient data to be included in this section.SpecifiersSeverity is based on the number of criteria endorsed. Individuals with mild gambling dis­order may exhibit only 4-5 of the criteria, with the most frequently endorsed criteria usu­ally related to preoccupation with gambling and ""chasing"" losses. Individuals with moderately severe gambling disorder exhibit more of the criteria (i.e., 6-7). Individuals with the most severe form will exhibit all or most of the nine criteria (i.e., 8-9). Jeopardiz­ing relationships or career opportunities due to gambling and relying on others to provide money for gambling losses are typically the least often endorsed criteria and most often oc­cur among those with more severe gambling disorder. Furthermore, individuals present­ing for treatment of gambling disorder typically have moderate to severe forms of the disorder.Diagnostic FeaturesGambling involves risking something of value in the hopes of obtaining something of greater value. In many cultures, individuals gamble on games and events, and most do so without experiencing problems. However, some individuals develop substantial impair­ment related to their gambling behaviors. The essential feature of gambling disorder is persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts personal, family, and/or vocational pursuits (Criterion A). Gambling disorder is defined as a cluster of four or more of the symptoms listed in Criterion A occurring at any time in the same 12-month period.A pattern of ""chasing one's losses"" may develop, with an urgent need to keep gam­bling (often with the placing of larger bets or the taking of greater risks) to undo a loss or series of losses. The individual may abandon his or her gambling strategy and try to win back losses all at once. Although many gamblers may ""chase"" for short periods of time, it is the frequent, and often long-term, ""chase"" that is characteristic of gambling disorder (Criterion A6). Individuals may lie to family members, therapists, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling; these instances of deceit may also include, but are not limited to, covering up illegal behaviors such as forgery, fraud, theft, or embez­zlement to obtain money with which to gamble (Criterion A7). Individuals may also en-gage in ""bailout"" behavior, turning to family or others for help with a desperate financial situation that w,as caused by gambling (Criterion A9).",
"132","Delirium","The essential feature of delirium is a disturbance of attention or awareness that is accom­panied by a change in baseline cognition that cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is manifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Questions must be repeated because the individual's attention wanders, or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention. The indi­vidual is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli. The disturbance in awareness is mani­fested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even to oneself.The disturbance develops over a short period of time, usually hours to a few days, and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day, often with worsening in the evening and night when external orienting stimuli decrease (Criterion B). There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a physiologi­cal consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication or with­drawal, use of a medication, or a toxin exposure, or a combination of these factors (Criterion E). The etiology should be coded according to the etiologically appropriate sub­type (i.e., substance or medication intoxication, substance withdrawal, another medicalcondition, or multiple etiologies). Delirium often occurs in the context of an underlying NCD. The impaired brain function of individuals with mild and major NCD renders them more vulnerable to delirium.There is an accompanying change in at least one other area that may include memory and learning (particularly recent memory), disorientation (particularly to time and place), alteration in language, or perceptual distortion or a perceptual-motor disturbance (Crite­rion C). The perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include misinterpretations, illusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are typically visual, but may occur in other modalities as well, and range from simple and uniform to highly complex. Normal atten­tion/arousal, delirium, and coma lie on a continuum, with coma defined as the lack of any response to verbal stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to diagnose delirium depends on there being a level of arousal sufficient for response to verbal stimulation; hence, delir­ium should not be diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D). Many noncoma tose pa­tients have a reduced level of arousal. Those patients who show only minimal responses to verbal stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized testing or even interview. This inability to engage should be classified as severe inattention. Low-arousal states (of acute onset) should be recognized as indicating severe inattention and cognitive change, and hence delirium. They are clinically indistinguishable from delirium diag­nosed on the basis of inattention or cognitive change elicited through cognitive testing and interview.",
"133","Other Specified Delirium","Major and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive and functional impairment. Major NCD corresponds to the condition referred to in DSM-IV as dementia, retained as an alter­native in this volume. The core feature of NCDs is acquired cognitive decline in one or more cognitive domains (Criterion A) based on both 1) a concern about cognition on the part of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician, and 2) performance on an objective assessment that falls below the expected level or that has been observed to de­cline over time. Both a concern and objective evidence are required because they are com­plementary. When there is an exclusive focus on objective testing, a disorder may go undiagnosed in high-functioning individuals whose currently ""normal"" performance ac­tually represents a substantial decline in abilities, or an illness may be incorrectly diag­nosed in individuals whose currently ""low"" performance does not represent a change from their own baseline or is a result of extraneous factors like test conditions or a passing illness. Alternatively, excessive focus on subjective symptoms may fail to diagnose illness in individuals with poor insight, or whose informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms, or it may be overly sensitive in the so-called worried well.A cognitive concern differs from a complaint in that it may or may not be voiced spon­taneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited by careful questioning about specific symp­toms that commonly occur in individuals with cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the introduction to this chapter). For example, memory concerns include difficulty remember­ing a short grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program; executive con­cerns include difßculty resuming a task when interrupted, organizing tax records, or planning a holiday meal. At the mild NCD level, the individual is likely to describe these tasks as being more difficult or as requiring extra time or effort or compensatory strategies. At the major NCD level, such tasks may only be completed with assistance or may be abandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level, individuals and their families may not no­tice such symptoms or may view them as normal, particularly in the elderly; thus, careful history taking is of paramount importance. The difficulties must represent changes rather than lifelong patterns: the individual or informant may clarify this issue, or the clinician can infer change from prior experience with the patient or from occupational or other clues. It is also critical to determine that the difficulties are related to cognitive loss rather than to motor or sensory limitations.Neuropsychological testing, with performance compared with norms appropriate to the patient's age, educational attainment, and cultural background, is part of the standard evaluation of NCDs and is particularly critical in the evaluation of mild NCD. For major NCD, performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate norms (3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically lies in the 1-2 standard de­viation range (between the 3rd and 16th percentiles). However, neuropsychological test­ing is not available in all settings, and neuropsychological thresholds are sensitive to the specific test(s) and norms employed, as well as to test conditions, sensory limitations, and intercurrent illness. A variety of brief office-based or ""bedside"" assessments, as describedin Table 1, can also supply objective data in settings where such testing is unavailable or infeasible. In any case, as with cognitive concerns, objective performance must be inter­preted in light of the individual's prior performance. Optimally, this information would be available from a prior administration of the same test, but often it must be inferred based on appropriate norms, along with the individual's educational history, occupation, and other factors. Norms are more challenging to interpret in individuals with very high or very low levels of education and in individuals being tested outside their own language or cultural background.Criterion B relates to the individual's level of independence in everyday functioning. Individuals with major NCD will have impairment of sufficient severity so as to interfere with independence, such that others will have to take over tasks that the individuals were previously able to complete on their own. Individuals with mild NCD will have preserved independence, although there may be subtle interference with function or a report that tasks require more effort or take more time than previously.The distinction between major and mild NCD is inherently arbitrary, and the disorders exist along a continuum. Precise thresholds are therefore difficult to determine. Careful history taking, observation, and integration with other findings are required, and the im­plications of diagnosis should be considered when an individual's clinical manifestations lie at a boundary.",
"134","Unspecified Delirium","",
"135","Due to Alzheimer’s Disease","Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome (Criterion A), the core features of ma­jor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro­gression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (Criterion B). The typical presentation is amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen­tations, particularly visuospatial and logopenic aphasie variants, also exist. At the mild NCD phase, Alzheimer's disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn­ing, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase, visuoconstructional/perceptual motor ability and language will also be impaired, partic­ularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until late in the course of the disease.A level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer's disease as the ""probable"" or ""possible"" etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed in both major and mild NCD if there is evidence of a causative Alzheimer's disease gene, ei­ther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au­topsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a typical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also be diagnosed as due to probable Alzheimer's disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de­gree of certainty that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for a possible Alzheimer's etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti­ologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei­mer's disease, the clinical features must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD (Criterion D).",
"136","Neurocognitive Disorder","Major or mild frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (NCD) comprises a number of syn­dromic variants characterized by the progressive development of behavioral and personality change and/or language impairment. The behavioral variant and three language variants (se­mantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic) exhibit distinct patterns of brain atrophy and some distinctive neuropathology. The criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the lan­guage variant to make the diagnosis, but many individuals present with features of both.Individuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with varying degrees of apathy or disinhibition. They may lose interest in socialization, self­care, and personal responsibilities, or display socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight is usually impaired, and this often delays medical consultation. The first referral is often to a psychiatrist. Individuals may develop changes in social style, and in religious and political beliefs, with repetitive movements, hoarding, changes in eating behavior, and hyperoral- ity. In later stages, loss of sphincter control may occur. Cognitive decline is less prominent, and formal testing may show relatively few deficits in the early stages. Common neuro­cognitive symptoms are lack of planning and organization, distractibility, and poor judg­ment. Deficits in executive function, such as poor performance on tests of mentalflexibility, abstract reasoning, and response inhibition, are present, but learning and mem­ory are relatively spared, and perceptual motor abilities are almost always preserved in the early stages.Individuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with pri­mary progressive aphasia with gradual onset, with three subtypes commonly described: semantic variant, agrammatic/nonfluent variant, and logopenic variant, and each variant has distinctive features and corresponding neuropathology.""Probable"" is distinguished from ""possible"" frontotemporal NCD by the presence of causative genetic factors (e.g., mutations in the gene coding for microtubule-associated pro­tein tau) or by the presence of distinctive atrophy or reduced activity in frontotemporal re­gions on structural or functional imaging.",
"137","With Lewy Bodies","Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB), in the case of major neurocognitive disorder (NCD), corresponds to the condition known as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The disorder includes not only progressive cognitive impairment (with early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and memory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (which can be a very early manifes­tation); as well as hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions. The symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no adequate under­lying cause can be found. The variable presentation of NCDLB symptoms reduces the like­lihood of all symptoms being observed in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough assessment of caregiver observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to assess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core feature is spontaneous parkinson­ism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive decline; by convention, major cognitive deficits are observed at least 1 year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must also be distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate diagnosis is essential to safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have se­vere sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used with extreme caution in managing the psychotic manifestations.The diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with the core or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of suf­ficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will often be insufficient evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the unspecified di­agnosis is most appropriate.",
"138","Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder","The diagnosis of major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder (NCD) requires the es­tablishment of an NCD (Criterion A) and the determination that cerebrovascular disease is the dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive deficits (Criteria B and C). Vaiscular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to microvascular disease; thepresentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions and their extent and location. The lesions may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse and occur in various combinations.Many individuals with major or mild vascular NCD present with multiple infarctions, with an acute stepwise or fluctuating decline in cognition, and intervening periods of stability and even some improvement. Others may have gradual onset with slow pro­gression, a rapid development of deficits followed by relative stability, or another complex presentation. Major or mild vascular NCD with a gradual onset and slow progression is generally due to small vessel disease leading to lesions in the white matter, basal ganglia, and/or thalamus. The gradual progression in these cases is often punctuated by acute events that leave subtle neurological deficits. The cognitive deficits in these cases can be at­tributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits, and complex attention, particularly speed of information processing, and executive ability are likely to be affected.Assessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular disease relies on history, phys­ical examination, and neuroimaging (Criterion C). Etiological certainty requires the dem­onstration of abnormalities on neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in significant diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking ""silent"" brain infarction and white mat­ter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive impairment is temporally associated with one or more well-documented strokes, a probable diagnosis can be made in the absence of neu­roimaging. Clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of stroke, with cognitive decline temporally associated with the event, or physical signs con­sistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis; pseudobulbar syndrome, visual field defect). Neuro­imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) evidence of cerebrovascular disease comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel infarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed single infarct or hemorrhage (e.g., in angu­lar gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or more lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem, or extensive and confluent white matter lesions. The latter is often termed small vessel dis­ease or subcortical ischemic changes on clinical neuroimaging evaluations.For mild vascular NCD, history of a single stroke or extensive white matter disease is gen­erally sufficient. For major vascular NCD, two or more strokes, a strategically placed stroke, or a combination of white matter disease and one or more lacunes is generally necessary.The disorder must not be better explained by another disorder. For example, promi­nent memory deficit early in the course might suggest Alzheimer's disease, early and prominent parkinsonian features would suggest Parkinson's disease, and a close associa­tion between onset and depression would suggest depression.",
"139","Due to Traumatic Brain Injury","Major or mild NCD due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an impact to the head, or other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, as can happen with blast injuries. Traumatic brain injury is defined as brain trauma with spe­cific characteristics that include at least one of the following: loss of consciousness, post­traumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs (e.g., positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a pre­existing seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis) (Criterion B). To be at­tributable to TBI, the NCD must present either immediately after the brain injury occurs or immediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past the acute post-injury period (Criterion C).The cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive abilitŷ , learning, and memory are common as well as slowing in speed of infor­mation processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more severe TBI in which there is brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or penetrating injury, there may be additional neurocognitive deficits, such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional dyspraxia.",
"140","Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder","Substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD is characterized by neurocognitive impairments that persist beyond the usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal (Criterion B). Initially, these manifestations can reflect slow recovery of brain functions from a period of prolonged substance use, and improvements in neurocognitive as well asbrain imaging indicators may be seen over many months. If the disorder continues for an extended period, persistent should be specified. The given substance and its use must be known to be capable of causing the observed impairments (Criterion C). While nonspecific decrements in a range of cognitive abilities can occur with nearly any substance of abuse and a variety of medications, some patterns occur more frequently with selected drug classes. For example, NCD due to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiaz­epines, barbiturates) may show greater disturbances in memory than in other cognitive functions. NCD induced by alcohol frequently manifests with a combination of impair­ments in executive-function and memory and learning domains. The temporal course of the substance-induced NCD must be consistent with that of use of the given substance (Criterion D). In alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff's) NCD, the features include prominent amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information with rapid forget­ting) and a tendency to confabulate. These manifestations may co-occur with signs of thi­amine encephalopathy (Wernicke's encephalopathy) with associated features such as nystagmus and ataxia. Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke's encephalopathy is typically charac­terized by a lateral gaze paralysis.In addition to or independent of the more common neurocognitive symptoms related to methamphetamine use (e.g., difficulties with learning and memory; executive func­tion), methamphetamine use can also be associated with evidence of vascular injury (e.g., focal weakness, unilateral incoordination, asymmetrical reflexes). The most common neu­rocognitive profile approximates that seen in vascular NCD.",
"141","Due to HIV Infection","HIV disease is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), which is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection drug use, unprotected sexual contact, or accidental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contami­nated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects several types of cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion of ""T-helper"" (CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to opportunistic infections and neoplasms. This advanced form of HIV infection is termed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established laboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with Western blot confirmation and/or polymerase chain reaction-based assays for HIV.Some individuals with HIV infection develop an NCD, which generally shows a ""sub­cortical pattern"" with prominently impaired executive function, slowing of processing speed, problems with more demanding attentional tasks, and difficulty in learning new information, but fewer problems with recall of learned information. In major NCD, slow­ing may be prominent. Language difficulties, such as aphasia, are uncommon, although reductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic processes can affect any part of the brain; therefore, other patterns are possible.",
"142","Due to Prion Disease","The classification of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to prion disease in­cludes NCDs due to a group of subacute spongiform encephalopathies (including Creutz­feldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler- Scheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia) caused by transmissible agents known as prions. The most common type is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically referred to as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much rarer and is associated with trans­mission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also called ""mad cow disease."" Typically, individuals with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, and abnormal move­ments such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically, the history reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the disorder is typically seen only at the major level. However, many individuals with the dis­order may have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of psychiatric symptoms, characterized a by low mood, withdrawal, and anxiety. Prion dis­ease is typically not diagnosed without at least one of the characteristic biomarker fea­tures: recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebro­spinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial forms, family history or genetic testing.PrevaienceThe annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases per million peo­ple. Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short survival.Development and CoursePrion disease may develop at any age in adults—the peak age for the sporadic CJD is ap­proximately 67 years—although it has been reported to occur in individuals spaniüng the teenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may include fatigue, anx­iety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration. After several weeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal gait or other movements that may be myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a rapidly progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses very rapidly to the major level of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can progress over 2 years and ap­pear similar in its course to other NCDs.Risk Factors and PrognosisEnvironmental. Cross-species transmission of prion infections, with agents that are closely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the mid- 1990s). Transmission by comeal transplantation and by human growth factor injection has been documented, and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been reported.Genetic and physiological. There is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases, associ­ated with an autosomal dominant mutation.Diagnostic iVlarlcersPrion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are no distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable bio­markers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as well as tau protein. Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently considered the most sen­sitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multi­focal gray matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions. In some individuals, the electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous dis­charges at a rate of 0.5-2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder.Differential DiagnosisOther major neurocognitive disorders. Major NCD due to prion disease may appear similar in its course to other NCDs, but prion diseases are typically distinguished by their rapid progression and prominent cerebellar and motor symptoms.Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson’s DiseaseDiagnostic CriteriaA. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.B. The disturbance occurs in the setting of established Parkinson’s disease.C. There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment.D. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.Major or mild neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease should be diagnosed if 1 and 2 are both met. iUlajor or miid neurocognitive disorder possibly due to Parltinson’s disease should be diagnosed if 1 or 2 is met:1. There is no evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease or another neurological, mental, or systemic disease or con­dition likely contributing to cognitive decline).2. The Parkinson’s disease clearly precedes the onset of the neurocognitive disorder.Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 332.0 (G20) Parkinson’s disease, followed by294.11 (F02.81) major neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease, with behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first 332.0 (G20) Parkinson’s disease, fol­lowed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s dis­ease, without bê havioral disturbance.For major neurocognitive disorder possibly due to Parkinson’s disease, code 331.9 (G31.9) major neurocognitive disorder possibly due to Parkinson’s disease. (Note: Do not use the additional code for Parkinson’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Parkinson’s disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)Diagnostic FeaturesThe essential feature of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Parkinson's disease is cognitive decline following the onset of Parkinson's disease. The disturbance must occur in the setting of established Parkinson's disease (Criterion B), and deficits must have developed gradually (Criterion C). The NCD is viewed as probably due to Parkinson's disease when there is no evidence of another disorder that might be contributing to the cognitive decline and when the Parkinson's disease clearly precedes onset of the NCD. The NCD is considered possibly due to Parkinson's disease either when there is no evidence of another disorder that might be contributing to the cognitive decline or when the Parkin­son's disease precedes onset of the NCD, but not both.",
"143","Due to Huntington’s Disease","Progressive cognitive impairment is a core feature of Huntington's disease, with early changes in executive function (i.e., processing speed, organization, and planning) rather than learn­ing and memory. Cognitive and associated behavioral changes often precede the emergence of the typical motor abnormalities of bradykinesia (i.e., slowing of voluntary movement) and chorea (i.e., involuntary jerking movements). A diagnosis of definite Huntington's dis­ease is given in the presence of unequivocal, extrapyramidal motor abnormalities in an in­dividual with either a family history of Huntington's disease or genetic testing showing a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HIT gene, located on chromosome 4.",
"145","Schizoid Personality Disorder","The essential feature of schizoid personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.Individuals with schizoid personality disorder appear to lack a desire for intimacy, seem indifferent to opportunities to develop close relationships, and do not seem to derive much satisfaction from being part of a family or other social group (Criterion Al). They prefer spending time by themselves, rather than being with other people. They often ap­pear to be socially isolated or ""loners"" and almost always choose solitary activities or hob­bies that do not include interaction with others (Criterion A2). They prefer mechanical or abstract tasks, such as computer or mathematical games. They may have very little interest in having sexual experiences with another person (Criterion A3) and take pleasure in few, if any, activities (Criterion A4). There is usually a reduced experience of pleasure from sen­sory, bodily, or interpersonal experiences, such as walking on a beach at sunset or having sex. These individuals have no close friends or confidants, except possibly a first-degree relative (Criterion A5).Individuals with schizoid personality disorder often seem indifferent to the approval or criticism of others and do not appear to be bothered by what others may think of them (Criterion A6). They may be oblivious to the normal subtleties of social interaction and of­ten do not respond appropriately to social cues so that they seem socially inept or super­ficial and self-absorbed. They usually display a ""bland"" exterior without visible emotional reactivity and rarely reciprocate gestures or facial expressions, such as smiles or nods (Cri­terion A7). They claim that they rarely experience strong emotions such as anger and joy. They often display a constricted affect and appear cold and aloof. However, in those very unusual circumstances in which these individuals become at least temporarily comfort­able in revealing themselves, they may acknowledge having painful feelings, particularly related to social interactions.Schizoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern of behavior occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psy­chotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, or if it is attrib­utable to the physiological effects of a neurological (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) or another medical condition (Criterion B).",
"146","Antisocial Personality Disorder","The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder. Because deceit and manipulation are central features of an­tisocial personality disorder, it may be especially helpful to integrate information acquired from systematic clinical assessment with information collected from collateral sources.For this diagnosis to be given, the individual must be at least age 18 years (Criterion B) and must have had a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15 years (Criterion C). Conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are vio­lated. The specific behaviors characteristic of conduct disorder fall into one of four cate­gories: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violation of rules.The pattern of antisocial behavior continues into adulthood. Individuals with antiso­cial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior (Criterion Al). They may repeatedly perform acts that are grounds for arrest (whether they are arrested or not), such as destroying property, harassing others, stealing, or pur­suing illegal occupations. Persons with this disorder disregard the wishes, rights, or feel­ings of others. They are frequently deceitful and manipulative in order to gain personal profit or pleasure (e.g., to obtain money, sex, or power) (Criterion A2). They may repeat­edly lie, use an alias, con others, or malinger. A pattern of impulsivity may be manifested by a failure to plan ahead (Criterion A3). Decisions are made on the spur of the moment, without forethought and without consideration for the consequences to self or others; this may lead to sudden changes of jobs, residences, or relationships. Individuals with antiso­cial personality disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and may repeatedly get into physical fights or commit acts of physical assault (including spouse beating or child beat­ing) (Criterion A4). (Aggressive acts that are required to defend oneself or someone else are not considered to be evidence for this item.) These individuals also display a reckless disregard for the safety of themselves or others (Criterion A5). This may be evidenced in their driving behavior (i.e., recurrent speeding, driving while intoxicated, multiple acci­dents). They may engage in sexual behavior or substance use that has a high risk for harm­ful consequences. They may neglect or fail to care for a child in a way that puts the child in danger.Individuals with antisocial personality disorder also tend to be consistently and ex­tremely irresponsible (Criterion A6). Irresponsible work behavior may be indicated by sig­nificant periods of unemployment despite available job opportunities, or by abandonment of several jobs without a realistic plan for getting another job. There may also be a pattern of repeated absences from work that are not explained by illness either in themselves or in their family. Financial irresponsibility is indicated by acts such as defaulting on debts, fail­ing to provide child support, or failing to support other dependents on a regular basis. In­dividuals with antisocial personality disorder show little remorse for the consequences of their acts (Criterion A7). They may be indifferent to, or provide a superficial rationaliza­tion for, having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from someone (e.g., 'Tife's unfair,"" ""losers de­serve to lose""). These individuals may blame the victims for being foolish, helpless, or deserving their fate (e.g., ""he had it coming anyway""); they may minimize the harmful consequences of their actions; or they may simply indicate complete indifference. They generally fail to compensate or make amends for their behavior. They may believe that everyone is out to ""help number one"" and that one should stop at nothing to avoid being pushed around.The antisocial behavior must not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (Criterion D).",
"147","Borderline Personality Disorder","The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.Individuals with borderline personality disorder make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment (Criterion 1). The perception of impending separation or rejection, or the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, affect, cognition, and behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They ex­perience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a real­istic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden despair in reaction to a clinician's announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when some­one important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may believe that this ""abandonment"" implies they are ""bad."" These abandonment fears are re­lated to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their franticefforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or sui­cidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.Individuals with borderline personality disorder have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships (Criterion 2). They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details early in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough, or is not ""there"" enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only with the expectation that the other person will ""be there"" in return to meet their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive. Such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently un­stable self-image or sense of self (Criterion 3). There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self­image, characterized by shifting goals, values, and vocational aspirations. There may be sudden changes in opinions and plans about career, sexual identity, values, and types of friends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment. Although they usually have a self­image that is based on being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings that they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These in­dividuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations.Individuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4). They may gamble, spend money irrespon­sibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, or drive recklessly. Individuals with this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilat­ing behavior (Criterion 5). Completed suicide occurs in 8%-10% of such individuals, and self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) and suicide threats and attempts are very common. Recurrent suicidality is often the reason that these individuals present for help. These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or by expectations that the individual assumes increased responsibility. Self-mutilation may occur during dissociative experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to feel or by expiating the individual's sense of being evil.Individuals with borderline personality disorder may display affective instability that is due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anx­iety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The basic dysphoric mood of those with borderline personality disorder is often disrupted by periods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satis­faction. These episodes may reflect the individual's extreme reactivity to interpersonal stresses. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may be troubled by chronic feel­ings of emptiness (Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek something to do. Individuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have dif­ficulty controlling their anger (Criterion 8). They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being evil. During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., de­personalization) may occur (Criterion 9), but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in re­sponse to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting min­utes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver's nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.",
"148","Histrionic Personality Disorder","The essential feature of histrionic personality disorder is pervasive and excessive emotion­ality and attention-seeking behavior. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is pres­ent in a variety of contexts.Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are uncomfortable or feel unappreci­ated when they are not the center of attention (Criterion 1). Often lively and dramatic, they tend to draw attention to themselves and may initially charm new acquaintances by their enthusiasm, apparent openness, or flirtatiousness. These qualities wear thin, however, as these individuals continually demand to be the center of attention. They commandeer the role of ""the life of the party."" If they are not the center of attention, they may do something dramatic (e.g., make up stories, create a scene) to draw the focus of attention to themselves. This need is often apparent in their behavior with a clinician (e.g., being flattering, bring­ing gifts, providing dramatic descriptions of physical and psychological symptoms that are replaced by new symptoms each visit).The appearance and behavior of individuals with this disorder are often inappropri­ately sexually provocative or seductive (Criterion 2). This behavior not only is directed to­ward persons in whom the individual has a sexual or romantic interest but also occurs in a wide variety of social, occupational, and professional relationships beyond what is ap­propriate for the social context. Emotional expression may be shallow and rapidly shifting (Criterion 3). Individuals with this disorder consistently use physical appearance to draw attention to themselves (Criterion 4). They are overly concerned with impressing others by their appearance and expend an excessive amount of time, energy, and money on clothes and grooming. They may ""fish for compliments"" regarding appearance and may be easily and excessively upset by a critical conunent about how they look or by a photograph that they regard as unflattering.These individuals have a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail (Criterion 5). Strong opinions are expressed with dramatic flair, but underlying reasons are usually vague and diffuse, without supporting facts and details. For example, an individual with histrionic personality disorder may comment that a certain individual is a wonderful human being, yet be unable to provide any specific examples of good qual­ities to support this opinion. Individuals with this disorder are characterized by self­dramatization, theatricality, and an exaggerated expression of emotion (Criterion 6). They may embarrass friends and acquaintances by an excessive public display of emotions (e.g., embracing casual acquaintances with excessive ardor, sobbing uncontrollably on minorsentimental occasions, having temper tantrums). However, their emotions often seem to be turned on and off too quickly to be deeply felt, which may lead others to accuse the in­dividual of faking these feelings.Individuals with histrionic personality disorder have a high degree of suggestibility (Cri­terion 7). Their opinions and feelings are easily influenced by others and by current fads. They may be overly trusting, especially of strong authority figures whom they see as mag­ically solving their problems. They have a tendency to play hunches and to adopt convic­tions quickly. Individuals with this disorder often consider relationships more intimate than they actually are, describing almost every acquaintance as ""my dear, dear friend"" or referring to physicians met only once or twice under professional circumstances by their first names (Criterion 8).",
"149","Narcissistic Personality Disorder","The essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandi­osity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is pres­ent in a variety of contexts.Individuals with this disorder have a grandiose sense of self-importance (Criterion 1). They routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their accomplishments, often appearing boastful and pretentious. They may blithely assume that others attribute the same value to their efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not forthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of their own accomplishments is an un­derestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic per­sonality disorder are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may ruminate about ""'long overdue"" admiration and privilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or privileged people.Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior, spe­cial, or unique and expect others to recognize them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel that they can only be understood by, and should only associate with, other people who are special or of high status and may attribute ""unique,"" ""perfect,"" or ""gifted"" qualities to those with whom they associate. Individuals with this disorder believe that their needs are spe­cial and beyond the ken of ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., ""mir­rored"") by the idealized value that they assign to those with whom they associate. They are likely to insist on having only the ""top"" person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or being affiliated with the ""best"" institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who dis­appoint them.Individuals with this disorder generally require excessive admiration (Criterion 4). Their self-esteem is almost invariably very fragile. Tliey may be preoccupied with how well they are doing and how favorably they are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need for constant attention and admiration. They may expect their arrival to be greeted with great farifare and are astonished if others do not covet their possessions. They may constantly fish for compliments, often with great charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these individ­uals' unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment (Criterion 5). They expect to be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this does not happen. For example, they may assume that they do not have to wait in line and that their priorities are so important that others should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to assist ""in their very important work."" This sense of entitlement, combined with a lack of sensitivity to the wants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others (Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or feel they need, no matter what it might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from others and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to form friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance their purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem. They often usuφ special privileges and extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so special.Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally have a lack of empathy and have difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective experiences, and feelings of others (Crite­rion 7). They may assume that others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend to discuss their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while failing to recognize that others also have feelings and needs. They are often contemptuous and impatient withothers who talk about their own problems and concerns. These individuals may be oblivious to the hurt their remarks may inflict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that ""I am now in the relationship of a lifetime!""; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When recognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as signs of weakness or vulnerability. Those who relate to individuals with narcissistic person­ality disorder typically find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest.These individuals are often envious of others or believe that oéiers are envious of them (Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their successes or possessions, feeling that they better deserve those achievements, admiration, or privileges. They may harshly devalue the contri­butions of others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment or praise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors characterize these individuals; they often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an individual with this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter's ""rudeness"" or ""stupidity"" or conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician.",
"150","Avoidant Personality Disorder","The essential feature of avoidant personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of social inhi­bition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.Individuals with avoidant personality disorder avoid work activities that involve sig­nificant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection (Cri­terion 1). Offers of job promotions may be declined because the new responsibilities might result in criticism from co-workers. These individuals avoid making new friends unless they are certain they will be liked and accepted without criticism (Criterion 2). Until they pass stringent tests proving the contrary, other people are assumed to be critical and dis­approving. Individuals with this disorder will not join in group activities unless there are repeated and generous offers of support and nurturance. Interpersonal intimacy is often difficult for these individuals, although they are able to establish intimate relationships when there is assurance of uncritical acceptance. They may act with restraint, have diffi­culty talking about themselves, and withhold intimate feelings for fear of being exposed, ridiculed, or shamed (Criterion 3).Because individuals with this disorder are preoccupied with being criticized or re­jected in social situations, they may have a markedly low threshold for detecting such re­actions (Criterion 4). If someone is even slightly disapproving or critical, they may feel extremely hurt. They tend to be shy, quiet, inhibited, and ""invisible"" because of the fear that any attention would be degrading or rejecting. They expect that no matter what they say, others will see it as ""wrong,"" and so they may say nothing at all. They react strongly to subtle cues that are suggestive of mockery or derision. Despite their longing to be active participants in social life, they fear placing their welfare in the hands of others. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder are inhibited in new interpersonal situations because they feel inadequate and have low self-esteem (Criterion 5). Doubts concerning social competence and personal appeal become especially manifest in settings involving inter­actions with strangers. These individuals believe themselves to be socially inept, person­ally unappealing, or inferior to others (Criterion 6). They are unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because these may prove embarrassing (Criterion 7). They are prone to exaggerate the potential dangers of ordinary situations, and a restricted lifestyle may result from their need for certainty and security. Someone with this disorder may cancel a job interview for fear of being embarrassed by not dressing appropriately. Marginal somatic symptoms or other problems may become the reason for avoiding new activities.",
"151","Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder","The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder attempt to maintain a sense of control through painstaking attention to rules, trivial details, procedures, lists, schedules, or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They are excessively careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary attention to detail and repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious to the fact that other people tend to become very annoyed at the delays and inconveniences that result from this behavior. For example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done, they will spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than spending a few moments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the tasks. Time is poorly allocated, and the most important tasks are left to the last moment. The perfection­ism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and distress in these individuals. They may become so involved in making every detail of a project absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion 2). For example, the completion of a written report is delayed by numerous time-consuming rewrites that all come up short of ""perfection."" Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual's life that are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray.Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder display excessive devotion to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (Criterion 3). This behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often feel that they do not have time to take an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing or to just relax. They may keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so that it may never occur. When they do take time for leisure activities or vacations, they are very uncomfortable un­less they have taken along something to work on so they do not ""waste time."" There may be a great concentration on household chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so that ""one could eat off the floor""). If they spend time with friends, it is likely to be in some kind of for­mally organized activity (e.g., sports). Hobbies or recreational activities are approached as serious tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master. The emphasis is on perfect performance. These individuals turn play into a structured task (e.g., correcting an infant for not putting rings on the post in the right order; telling a toddler to ride his or her tri­cycle in a straight line; turning a baseball game into a harsh ""lesson"").Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be excessively con­scientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (Crite­rion 4). They may force themselves and others to follow rigid moral principles and very strict standards of performance. They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own mistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and insist on quite literal compliance, with no rule bending for extenuating circumstances. For example, the individual will not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a tele­phone call because ""neither a borrower nor a lender be"" or because it would be ""bad"" forthe person's character. These qualities should not be accounted for by the individual's cul­tural or religious identification.Individuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects, even when they have no sentimental value (Criterion 5). Often these individuals will ad­mit to being ""pack rats."" They regard discarding objects as wasteful because ""you never know when you might need something"" and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of the things they have saved. Their spouses or roommates may complain about the amount of space taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances, and so on.Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others (Criterion 6). They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that everything be done their way and that people conform to their way of doing things. They often give very detailed instructions about how things should be done (e.g., there is one and only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a doghouse) and are surprised and irritated if others suggest creative alternatives. At other times they may reject offers of help even when behind schedule because they believe no one else can do it right.Individuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a standard of living far below what they can afford, believing that spending must be tightly controlled to provide for future catastrophes (Criterion 7). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals with this disorder are so concerned about having things done the one ""correct"" way that they have trouble going along with anyone else's ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail and are unwilling to consider changes. Totally wrapped up in their own perspective, they have difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of others. Friends and colleagues may be­come frustrated by this constant rigidity. Even when individuals with obsessive-compul­sive personality disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise, they may stubbornly refuse to do so, arguing that it is ""the principle of the thing.""",
"152","Due to Another Medical Condition","The essential feature of a personality change due to another medical condition is a persis­tent personality disturbance that is judged to be due to the direct pathophysiological ef­fects of a medical condition. The personality disturbance represents a change from the individual's previous characteristic personality pattern. In children, this condition may be manifested as a marked deviation from normal development rather than as a change in a stable personality pattern (Criterion A). There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the personality change is the direct physiological consequence of another medical condition (Criterion B). The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance is better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The disturbance must also cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E).Common manifestations of the personality change include affective instability, poor impulse control, outbursts of aggression or rage grossly out of proportion to any precipi­tating psychosocial stressor, marked apathy, suspiciousness, or paranoid ideation. The phenomenology of the change is indicated using the subtypes listed in the criteria set. An individual with the disorder is often characterized by others as ""not himself [or herself]."" Although it shares the term ""personality"" with the other personality disorders, this diag­nosis is distinct by virtue of its specific etiology, different phenomenology, and more vari­able onset and course.The clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on the nature and localiza­tion of the pathological process. For example, injury to the frontal lobes may yield symp­toms such as lack of judgment or foresight, facetiousness, disinhibition, and euphoria. Right hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality changes in asso­ciation with unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia (i.e., inability of the individual to recognize a bodily or functional deficit, such as the existence of hemiparesis), motor im- persistence, and other neurological deficits.",
"153","Other Specified Personality Disorder","The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilic interest and to those who categorically deny any sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report dis­tress or psychosocial problems because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences, they could be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if they declare no distress, demon­strated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of tids sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having voyeuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder.Nondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to have been spy­ing repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual activity on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior, and who may report that known episodes of watching unsuspecting naked or sexually ac­tive persons were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of ob­serving unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons but contest any significant or sustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about watching others nude or involved in sexual activity, it follows that they would also reject feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. De­spite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed with voyeuristic dis­order. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior constitutes sufficient support for voyeurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B).""Recurrent"" spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual ac­tivity (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be inter­preted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of watching the same victim or if there is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential interest in secret watching of naked or sexually active unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; the criteria may also be met if the individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual interest.The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of voyeurism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active others is not merely transient.Adolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate the risk of pathologizing normative sexual interest and behavior during pubertal adoles­cence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C).",
"154","Unspecified Personality Disorder","",
"155","Exhibitionistic Disorder","The diagnostic criteria for exhibitionistic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who categorically deny any sexual attraction to exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for exposing, they may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (exemplified by absence of anxiety, obsessions, and guilt or shame about these paraphilic impulses) and are not impaired by this sexual interest in other important areas of functioning, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them, they could be ascertained as having exhibitionistic sexual interest but not be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder.Examples of nondisclosing individuals include those who have exposed themselves repeatedly to unsuspecting persons on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fan­tasies about such sexual behavior and who report that known episodes of exposure were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of sexual behavior involv­ing genital exposure but refute any significant or sustained sexual interest in such behav­ior. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving genital exposure, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder despite their negative self-report. Recurrent exhibitionistic behavior constitutes sufficient support for exhibitionism (Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (Criterion B).""Recurrent"" genital exposure to unsuspecting others (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on sep­arate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of exposure to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in genital exposure to unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for di­agnosis, as criteria may be met by an individual's acknowledging intense exhibitionistic sexual interest with distress and/or impairment.The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of exhibitionism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in exposing one's genitals to unsuspect­ing others is not merely transient. This might be expressed in clear evidence of repeated behaviors or distress over a nontransient period shorter than 6 months.",
"156","Frotteuristic Disorder","The diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who relatively freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who firmly deny any sexual attraction from touch­ing or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual regardless of considerable objective evi­dence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial impairment due to their sexual preferences for touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual, they could be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (demon­strated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame) about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having frotteuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder.Nondisclosing individuals include, for instance, individuals known to have been touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals on separate occasions but who contest any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior. Such individuals may re­port that identified episodes of touching or rubbing against an unwilling individual were all unintentional and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals but contest any major or persistent sexual interest in this. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about touching or rubbing, they would consequently reject feeling distressed or psychosocially impaired by such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing position, such individuals may be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. Recurrent frotteuristic behavior constitutes satisfactory support for frotteurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and concurrently demonstrates that this paraphili- cally motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B).""Recurrent"" touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual (i.e., multiple vic­tims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be inteφreted as three or more vic­tims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be inteφreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of touching or rubbing against the same unwilling individ­ual, or corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals. Note that multiple victims are a sufficient but not a nec­essary condition for diagnosis; criteria may also be met if the individual acknowledges in­tense frotteuristic sexual interest with clinically significant distress and/or impairment.The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of frotteurism must persist for at least 6 months, should also be inteφreted as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual is not transient. Hence, the duration part of Criterion A may also be met if there is clear evidence of recurrent behaviors or distress over a shorter but nontransient time period.PrevaienceFrotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexual touching of or rubbing against another individual, may occur in up to 30% of adult males in the general population. Approximately10%-14% of adult males seen in outpatient settings for paraphilic disorders and hypersex­uality have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder. Hence, whereas the population prevalence of frotteuristic disorder is unknown, it is not likely that it exceeds the rate found in selected clinical settings.Development and CourseAdult males with frotteuristic disorder often report first becoming aware of their sexual in­terest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging adulthood. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling oth­ers in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder. Although there is no minimum age for the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to differentiate from conduct-disor­dered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of frotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by definition requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjec­tive distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity; hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by touching or rubbing against unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course of frotteuristic disorder is likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advanc­ing age may be associated with decreasing frotteuristic sexual preferences and behavior.Risk and Prognostic FactorsTemperamental. Nonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality might be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. However, frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic disorder, so risk factors for frotteurism should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder.Gender-Related Diagnostic IssuesThere appear to be substantially fewer females with frotteuristic sexual preferences than males.Differential DiagnosisConduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual should be lacking.Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders, particularly those involving stimu­lants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by in­toxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained sexual interest in touching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent frotteuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated sug­gest that frotteuristic disorder might be present.ComorbidityKnown comorbidities in frotteuristic disorder are largely based on research with males suspected of or convicted for criminal acts involving sexually motivated touching of or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to other individuals with a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual interest. Conditions that occur comorbidly with frotteuristic disorder in­clude hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder and voyeuristic disorder. Conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, depressivedisorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders also co-occur. Potential differential diagnoses for frotteuristic disorder sometimes occur also as comor- bid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for frotteuristic disorder and possible comorbid conditions as separate questions.Sexual Masochism DisorderDiagnostic Criteria 302.83 (F65.51)A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or othenwise made to suffer, as manifested by fan­tasies, urges, or behaviors.B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impair­ment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.Specify if:With asphyxiophilia: If the individual engages in the practice of achieving sexual arousal related to restriction of breathing.Specify if:In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in masochistic sexual behaviors are restricted.In full remission: There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at last 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.Diagnostic FeaturesThe diagnostic criteria for sexual masochism disorder are intended to apply to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests. Such individuals openly acknowl­edge intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. If these individuals also re­port psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, they may be diagnosed with sex­ual masochism disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress, exemplified by anxiety, ob­sessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other personal goals, they could be ascertained as having masochistic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder.The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual masoch­ism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer is not merely transient. However, the disorder can be diag­nosed in the context of a clearly sustained but shorter time period.",
"157","Sexual Sadism Disorder","The diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests and to those who deny any sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Individuals who openly acknowledge intense sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of others are referred to as ""admitting individuals."" If these individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or prefer­ences for the physical or psychological suffering of another individual, they may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no distress, exempli­fied by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not ham­pered by them in pursuing other goals, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them, then they could be ascertained as having sadistic sexual interest but they would not meet criteria for sexual sadism disorder.Examples of individuals who deny any interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual include individuals known to have inflicted pain or suffering on mul­tiple victims on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual behavior and who may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were either un­intentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past episodes of sexual behavior involving the infliction of pain or suffering on a nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant or sustained sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving sexual arousal to pain and suffering, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially im­paired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder despite their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior constitutes clinical support for the presence of the paraphilia of sexual sadism (by satisfying Criterion A) and simultane­ously demonstrates that their paraphilically motivated behavior is causing clinically signif­icant distress, harm, or risk of harm to others (satisfying Criterion B).""Recurrent"" sexual sadism involving nonconsenting others (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion, if there are multiple instances of infliction of pain and suffering to the same victim, or if there is cor­roborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in pain and suffering involving multiple victims. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as the criteria may be met if the individual acknowl­edges intense sadistic sexual interest.The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual sadism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guide­line, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and suffering on nonconsenting victims is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be met if there is a clearly sustained but shorter period of sadistic behaviors.",
"158","Pedophilic Disorder","The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepuber­tal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Examples of disclosing this paraphilia include candidly acknowledging an intense sexual interest in children and indicating that sexual interest in children is greater than or equal to sexual interest in physically mature individuals. If individuals also complain that their sex­ual attractions or preferences for children are causing psychosocial difficulties, they may be di­agnosed with pedophilic disorder. However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt, shame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited by their paraphilic im­pulses (according to self-report, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and le­gally recorded histories indicate that they have never acted on their impulses, then these individuals have a pedophilic sexual orientation but not pedophilic disorder.Examples of individuals who deny attraction to children include individuals who are known to have sexually approached multiple children on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about sexual behavior involving children, and who may further claim that the known episodes of physical contact were all unintentional and nonsexual. Other indi­viduals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual behavior involving children but deny any significant or sustained sexual interest in children. Since these individuals may deny experi­ences impulses or fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling subjectively dis­tressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder despite the absence of self-reported distress, provided that there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for 6 months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges or experi­enced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence of the disorder (Criterion B).Presence of multiple victims, as discussed above, is sufficient but not necessary for di­agnosis; that is, the individual can still meet Criterion A by merely acknowledging intense or preferential sexual interest in children.The Criterion A clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of pedophilia have per­sisted for 6 months or longer, is intended to ensure that the sexual attraction to children is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be made if there is clinical evidence of sustained persistence of the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month duration can­not be precisely determined.",
"159","Fetishistic Disorder","The paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and repetitive use of or de­pendence on nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on a (typically nongenital) body part as primary elements associated with sexual arousal (Criterion A). A diagnosis of fetishistic dis­order must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial role impairment (Criterion B). Common fetish objects include female undergarments, male or female footwear, rubber articles, leather clothing, or other wearing apparel. Highly eroticized body parts asso­ciated with fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is not uncommon for sexualized fetishes to include both inanimate objects and body parts (e.g., dirty socks and feet), and for this reason the definition of fetishistic disorder now re-incorporates partialism (i.e., an exclusive focus on a body part) into its boundaries. Partialism, previously considered a paraphilia not otherwise specified disorder, had historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-ΠΙ.Many individuals who self-identify as fetishist practitioners do not necessarily report clinical impairment in association with their fetish-associated behaviors. Such individuals could be considered as having a fetish but not fetishistic disorder. A diagnosis of fetishistic disorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the behaviors in Criterion A and the clin­ically significant distress or impairment in functioning noted in Criterion B.",
"160","Transvestic Disorder","The diagnosis of transvestic disorder does not apply to all individuals who dress as the op­posite sex, even those who do so habitually. It applies to individuals whose cross-dressing or thoughts of cross-dressing are always or often accompanied by sexual excitement (Cri­terion A) and who are emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel it impairs social or in­terpersonal functioning (Criterion B). The cross-dressing may involve only one or two articles of clothing (e.g., for men, it may pertain only to women's undergarments), or it may involve dressing completely in the iimer and outer garments of the other sex and (in men) may include the use of women's wigs and make-up. Transvestic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection, may co-occur with cross-dressing in various ways. In younger males, cross-dressing often leads to masturbation, following which any female clothing is removed. Older males often leam to avoid masturbating or doing anything to stimulate the penis so that the avoidance of ejaculation allows them to prolong their cross-dressing session. Males with female part­ners sometimes complete a cross-dressing session by having intercourse with their part­ners, and some have difficulty maintaining a sufficient erection for intercourse without cross-dressing (or private fantasies of cross-dressing).Clinical assessment of distress or impairment, like clinical assessment of transvestic sexual arousal, is usually dependent on the individual's self-report. The pattern of behav­ior ""purging and acquisition"" often signifies the presence of distress in individuals with transvestic disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man) who has spent a great deal of money on women's clothes and other apparel (e.g., shoes, wigs) discards the items (i.e., purges them) in an effort to overcome urges to cross-dress, and then begins acquiring a woman's wardrobe all over again.",
"161","Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder","Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72 hours prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia (>100.4°F or >38.0°C on at least two occasions, measured orally), associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neu­roleptic malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological side effects of anti­psychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflecting a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are more likely to support the diagnosis of neuroleptic malig­nant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as ""lead pipe"" in its most severe form and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase elevation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or altered consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign. Affected individuals may appear alert but dazed and unre­sponsive, consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—mani­fested by tachycardia (rate >25% above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation (systolic or diastolic >25% above baseline) or fluctuation (>20 mmHg diastolic change or >25 mmHg systolic change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be seen at any time but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate >50% above baseline) is common, and respiratory distress—resulting from metabolic acidosis, hyper­metabolism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli—can oc­cur and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.A workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other infectious, toxic, met­abolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or complications is essential (see the section ""Dif­ferential Diagnosis"" later in this discussion). Although several laboratory abnormalities are associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no single abnormality is specific to the diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome may have leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations, and elevations in se­rum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas electroencephalography shows gen­eralized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal cases have been nonspecific and variable, de­pending on complications.Development and CourseEvidence from database studies suggests incidence rates for neuroleptic malignant syn­drome of 0.01%-0.02% among individuals treated with antipsycho tics. The temporal pro­gression of signs and symptoms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Some cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within the first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases. The mean recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7-10 days, with most individuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of in­dividuals in whom residual neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hyper- metabolic symptoms resolved. Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in most cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; however, fatality rates of 10%-20% have been reported when the disorder is not recognized. Although many individuals do not experi­ence a recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsy­chotic medication, some do, especially when antipsychotics are reinstituted soon after an episode.Risk and Prognostic FactorsNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual after antipsychotic drug administration. It is not specific to any neuropsychiatric diagnosis and may occur in individuals without a diagnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists. Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a heightened risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome include agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency. A prior episode associated with antipsychotics has been described in 15%-20% of index cases, suggesting underlying vulnerability in some patients; however, genetic findings based on neurotransmitter receptor polymorphisms have not been replicated consistently.Nearly all dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuroleptic malignant sjmdrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater risk compared with low- potency agents and newer atypical antipsychotics. Partial or milder forms may be associ­ated with newer antipsychotics, but neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity even with older drugs. Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings (e.g., metoclopra­mide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated. Parenteral administration routes, rapid titration rates, and higher total drug dosages have been associated with increased risk; however, neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually occurs within the therapeutic dos­age range of antipsychotics.Differential DiagnosisNeuroleptic malignant syndrome must be distinguished from other serious neurological or medical conditions, including central nervous system infections, inflammatory or au­toimmune conditions, status epilepticus, subcortical structural lesions, and systemic con­ditions (e.g., pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, tetanus, heat stroke).Neuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar syndromes resulting from the use of other substances or medications, such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine ag­onists; alcohol or sedative withdrawal; malignant hyperthermia occurring during anes­thesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics.In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syn­drome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a drug- induced form of malignant catatonia.Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia333.72 (G24.02) Medication-Induced Acute DystoniaAbnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the eyes (oculogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis), limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.IVledication-lnduced Acute Al<atlnisia333.99 (G25.71) Medication-Induced Acute AkathisiaSubjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive move­ments (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still), developing within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a medi­cation (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat ex­trapyramidal symptoms.Tardive Dyskinesia333.85 (G24.01) Tardive DyskinesiaInvoluntary athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few weeks) generally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (but sometimes involving the pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk muscles) developing in association with the use of a neuroleptic medication for at least a few months.Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older persons. In some patients, movements of this type may appear after discontinuation, or after change or reduction in dosage, of neuroleptic medications, in which case the condition is called neuroleptic withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia. Because withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia is usually time-limited, lasting less than 4-8 weeks, dyskinesia that persists beyond this win­dow is considered to be tardive dyskinesia.Tardive Dystonia Tardive Akathisia333.72 (G24.09) Tardive Dystonia333.99 (G25.71 ) Tardive AkathisiaTardive syndrome involving other types of movement problems, such as dystonia or akathisia, which are distinguished by their late emergence in the course of treatment and their potential persistence for months to years, even in the face of neuroleptic discontinu­ation or dosage reduction.Medication-Induced Postural Tremor333.1 (G25.1) Medication-Induced Postural TremorFine tremor (usually in the range of 8-12 Hz) occurring during attempts to maintain a pos­ture and developing in association with the use of medication (e.g., lithium, antidepres­sants, valproate). This tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety, caffeine, and other stimulants.Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder333.99 (G25.79) Other Medication-Induced Movement DisorderThis category is for medication-induced movement disorders not captured by any of the specific disorders listed above. Examples include 1) presentations resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are associated with medications other than neuroleptics and 2) other medication-induced tardive conditions.Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome995.29 (T43.205A) Initial encounter995.29 (T43.205D) Subsequent encounter995.29 (T43.205S) SequelaeAntidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a set of symptoms that can occur after an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an antidepressant medication that was taken continuously for at least 1 month. Symptoms generally begin within 2-4 days and typically include specific sensory, somatic, and cognitive-emotional manifestations. Fre­quently reported sensory and somatic symptoms include flashes of lights, ""electric shock"" sensations, nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights. Nonspecific anxiety and feelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms are alleviated by restarting the same medication or starting a different medication that has a similar mechanism of action— for example, discontinuation symptoms after withdrawal from a serotonin-norepineph- rine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify as antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms should not have been present before the antidepressant dosage was reduced and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic or hypomanie episode, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, somatic symptom disorder).Diagnostic FeaturesDiscontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluox­etine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, selegi­line, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome depends on the dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are stopped abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the great­est risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with discontinuation symptoms, but such symptoms oc­cur for all types of antidepressants.Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other substances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no pathognomonic symptoms. In­stead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin 2-A days after the last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symptoms such as dizziness, ringing in the ears, ""electric shocks in the head,"" an inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypo- mania or euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence that the discontinuation syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability associated with the previous treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based solely on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stim­ulant augmentation of an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant with­drawal symptoms (see ""Stimulant Withdrawal"" in the chapter ""Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders"") rather than the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described here.",
